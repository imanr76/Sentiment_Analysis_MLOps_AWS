"I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it  tried it on  sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first  it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5'2""  140 lbs.). the size was good  but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally  and most importantly  it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c",0,Skirts
I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed  not the same colors as the picture  spandex material  the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.,0,Dresses
"This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to ""bloop"" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.  i'm busty  but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered  so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't",0,Blouses
I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.,0,Legwear
To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down,0,Dresses
"Gorgeous sleeves  flattering neckline...and a voluminous torso. i loved the fit of the top portion so much  i decided to buy it  knowing it would require alteration. the seamstress removed a *significant* amount of bulk and added vintage buttons to clasp the inverted pleat. i find many of these ""easy breezy"" tops create a shapeless look. extra volume in both the front and back creates a needlessly rotund profile. despite excellent posture  i looked both hunched and pregnant in the unaltered silh",0,Knits
I wanted to love it - the color is great  the embroidery pretty  but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much. if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you. i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer.,0,Knits
Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.,0,Jackets
The jumpsuit is very pretty but it's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am 5'7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.,0,Pants
There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model  the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now  after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture  i think the model is holding her a,0,Dresses
This dress is stunning.  it is a great classic  that i wished had worked out for me.  i went through 3 different dresses  and each time  the cap sleeve would tear.  there is not much room  if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing.  i am so disappointed.  it wasn' even tearing on a seam (so there was no way to repair it).  if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner  it would most likely work....it is not for a wedding with dancing!,0,Dresses
"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat  the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium  worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning  so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her.",0,Sweaters
While these seem like interesting designs which i applaud!  the execution in the design of the fabric is not appealing.,0,Knits
Beautiful dress appears well-made  but unfortunately i wasn't able to get it on! about 6 inch gap in the zipper over chest area. first time i've ever sent something back to retailer for not fitting.,0,Dresses
If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then  it's surprisingly fun to wear.,0,Skirts
"I ordered the black & white  00 petite. i'm 5' 2""  96 lbs. and i order petite sizes all the time. the length for the size i ordered is about 23"" (on the back  from neckline) which is great for me; however  the length on the sides is way too short. the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only 9.25""  so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans. not at all the way it shows on the model. i would order 00  regular length  but then the sleeves will b",0,Blouses
I have a love/hate relationship with these jeans. when i first put them on  i felt like i had finally found my favorite pair of jeans. everything about how they fit and looked was just perfect - and they were offered in a petite size! but then two hours later they were sagging. the fabric is so cozy  but it just stretches too much  too fast. i am not willing to give up yet  so i ordered another pair in a smaller size. i'm less than thrilled about having to shell out the $$ for two pairs  but i r,0,Jeans
The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory  but the top in reality is more beige. well  i'm blonde with fair skin  so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality  with it really being beige  having pleats everywhere  and being a crinkly fabric  it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts,0,Blouses
When i received this tank  i ordered the blue  i almost returned it because it seemed really thin  almost see through. however  once i tried it on it had a good fit  not see through  just lightweight and breezy. i especially like the twisted details on the straps. i would suggest a bralette with a cross back for comfort  especially because it is on the thin side.,0,Knits
"I don't think the sweater looks like the one pictured. it's pretty and i love off the shoulder sweaters  but i have to say it's a little scratchy and its a lighter grey than what shows on my computer screen. if i hadn't gotten it on sale and with an additional birthday discount i would send it back. it also runs big. i got an xs/s and it fits perfectly. im 5'6"" and weigh 140. i usually wear a medium in most things and am a size 8. i like it a lot  but i don't love it. it also reeked of patchouli",0,Sweaters

I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.,0,Knits
So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.,0,Blouses
Beautiful detail and soft sweater. i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short. arms were long and baggy in comparison. given the fit  i didn't think the small would work. really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back.,0,Sweaters
I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me  but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue  this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick  making it a bulkier shirt  then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say  this one was returned  sale or no sale.,0,Knits
Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric  but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer  but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother  otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.    now on to the size... i'm a plus size girl (size 18) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge  i ordere,0,Dresses

It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress  but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price  i expect something more exciting than what is  really  just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer  and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede,0,Dresses
I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute  easy top to wear  but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming  which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally  i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.,0,Knits
I'm so disappointed with the fit of this top. it is extremely short  even for my 5'2 frame. sizing up will not fix the length. too bad  because the shirt is cute.,0,Blouses
I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size.     the material is so rough  scratchy & uncomfortable. they should have used a softer fabric. the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received. at $100  i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous  matching line. i didn't notice the mismatched sleeves of the,0,Blouses
I'm usually a small but the skirt of the dress was a bit loose and added love handles to my figure when i wear it. a smaller size would work better. it's cute and i love it but the material is form fitting and do a larger size isn't flattering. an xsmall for me,0,Dresses
Disappointing  back is yellowish and looks strange. the front view is cute but doesn't match the fabric on the back at all. can't imagine why you would do that?,0,Knits
When i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated  as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment. well  i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything but..the design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted it's more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik,0,Blouses
The top falls nicely  great quality  the lace is beautiful. however  the sleeves are too wide and puffy. the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out. the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it.,0,Knits
The material is thin and of poor quality.  it snagged the first time i wore it. the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated.,0,Knits
Colors washed me out  i need more vibrant colors. so cute on the model,0,Dresses
I love the design and fit and quality. have been looking for a long-line top like this and was willing to pay full price. i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely. smooths it all out. i'm a 38c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top.     here's my issue - wore it once and the colors ran! i was so excited to wear this i didn't even wash the top (i rinsed and dried the bottom  though). and i'm not a swimmer. just let,0,Swim
The other reviewers are right  this runs huge. why have a number of cute tops been running so large lately?! i'm 5'1 and 100 lbs and was drowning in the xxs petite. it also almost reached my knees. i thought it'd be a cute little tunic to wear in the fall but it just looks ridiculous because of how large it is and how there's no taper or shape. maybe even order 2 sizes down. the quality is pretty good if you can make the sizing work for you.,0,Dresses
Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.,0,Fine gauge
I fell in love with this cute top  however after reading reviews  i am going to return it. seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions. who wants to dry clean a tank top? not me  sadly. too bad. style was cute and color was awesome.,0,Knits
"This shirt looks nice on the model  but it felt stiff and unflattering on me. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  and the size 4 fit overall. i just didn't happen to like it on me.",0,Blouses
Loved the color and looked super cute in the photo but when i got it home it was way too big in chest area  waist area & too wide at bottom. i'm pretty small but i'm not sure what the right body shape would be for this.,0,Knits
When i wore this the two times i did  i got a ton of compliments. it runs small  and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear  the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly  i would not recommend buying it for that reason.,0,Dresses
It is a very pretty skirt but arrived extremely wrinkled and the waist is very fitted. overall i probably would not have purchased it if i had actually seen it in the store.,0,Skirts
Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .,0,Sweaters
This was too big in the arms & i didn't like how there was only one button toward the top so that it made your body look hippy. little too itchy too. best thing about it was the look of the slouchy collar.,0,Sweaters
"I love the look of this dress on model but sadly  fit didn't work out. very short waisted and tight across chest with very ample arm holes. i'm 5'8""  155  34c  reliably a size 10. this dress seemed at least 2 sizes off for me. my daughter  usually a size 2  could wear it except for the arm hole size (and the fact that it's 158 dollars and she's 13....going back.) btw  ""novelty print"" means ""ice cream novelty""  little popsicles with bites taken out - cute but more juvenile than i expected.",0,Dresses
I really love the idea behind this. however  the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops  and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.,0,Knits
I ordered this 3 months ago  and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess  is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin  itchy  doesn&#39;t drape very well  and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale  but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back.,0,Sweaters
Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.,0,Layering
This shirt is gorgeous at first glance. the quality is there and it has a beautiful design...from the front  that is. but it is huge and billowy with back pleats. i cannot imagine this being flattering on anyone. it just adds so much volume to the top. i am thin and petite so maybe that was the issue  but i just can't see adding so much volume. this was a total miss for me. such a shame. would have been great without all the extra volume in back.,0,Blouses
"I tried yellow motif  but unfortunately  i did not purchase it.  it was quite difficult to explain why it did not work for me...  i liked its floral pattern and shape of sleeves.  texture was ok.  usually  i like a cool touch of linen.  but this t-shirt was not as comfortable as the other products made of linen.  i was not quite sure; it just was not right for me.  only word i could think was ""average.""  personally  i do not recommend it  but who knows  maybe it is right for you...  so  try wear",0,Knits
"I think this will work well on very busty hourglass figures or very petite frames; but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors. i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular  and my shoulders are broader than my hips (w/a 34b chest). i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops  and  had i kept this  i would have gone with the m. ---------- this shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep (~1"" above my elbow) and made my arms look huge. fyi  the v neck is very de",0,Fine gauge
In the photo  this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing. i am 5'7  always take a size medium but on me  the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just didn't fit properly. the collar doesn't fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly. if you try to use the button  it stretches and looks terrible. in the back  it falls short. it's going back.,0,Sweaters
So despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways. the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect. the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it's right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show. it's unfortunate because this dress is adorable. it would fit tts except length. unfortunately this one has to go back.,0,Dresses
This top is really cute but shorter in length than expected.  plus  it shrunk considerably!,0,Knits
I ordered these pants in black and brick. the pattern is great  but the sizing and fit are way off. i usually wear an 8 or a medium in retailer. i ordered these pants in a 10  12  and 12 petite. the 10 actually fit  but there is no stretch in these fitted pants. they were very uncomfortable to walk or sit in. however  if you're standing up all day and not doing much moving around  these pants are perfect! the print is great in both black and brick. i couldn't decide which one i liked best. wish th,0,Pants
I was looking forward to trying this on after seeing it in the catalog. i wear an xs or small in retailer tops and tried this on in an xs. it was huge. reminded me of a maternity top. it was much more flowy on me than it looks on the model. the material was nice  thin but not see through. the macrame detailing seemed well made. i'd recommend this if you're looking for a flowy top but definitely size down.,0,Knits
I thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it  either with opening in front or back. it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure  (hook and eye or snap) at the top. it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily. overall glad i bought it.,0,Blouses
"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo  absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties  it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.    i did not even want to try it on  it's that bad. i considered adding a photo  but was too horrified.  for reference  i'm 5'10""  approximately the height/ size of the model  but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it ",0,Dresses
The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass  gel deodorant  etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!,0,Dresses
Nice material  hits high waisted  mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good  you couldn't tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer.,0,Dresses
If you have muscular thighs  like me  these won't fit well. i'm usually a size 8-fitted/10-relaxed  i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part. had to return for not fitting well. but the quality of the product was nice.,0,Pants
"Perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts  or the cut of this was not right for me  but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didn't lay right on me. sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small.",0,Knits
This truly is a dress and not a tunic. i normally wear a medium but they were sold out so i thought i would try a l petite. i am only 5'4 and the large p was really long. i could definitely wear as a dress with tights. i am hoping it comes back in stock so i can try a medium p. unfortunately it is going back. cute sweater as pictured on the model!,0,Dresses
Overall  the dress is beautiful  easy  and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo  if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered  but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part  the fit is true to size. but as a petit  the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for. i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!,0,Dresses
I am a curvy girl and bought these jeans in a size 31. i don't have stick legs  and the jeans have worn right through were my thighs rub together. with the old pilcro material  this did not happen! this is a super soft jean  and although the fit was good  they just didn't last.,0,Jeans
This blouse is a beautiful color and i love the dot design and texture. however  it is a much baggier fit than i expected based on the photo  and it looks a little bit like a maternity shirt on me. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and i bought a size medium.,0,Blouses
I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off  it's about 3 sizes too big. second off  it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.,0,Dresses
I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly  ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.,0,Jackets
I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty  and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately  the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big  and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well  so i don't think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung  which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded,0,Knits
I was bummed about this top. detail on back is pretty  even so  not worth it. i'm usually an xs i'm  120 lbs and it fit true to size. guess i had higher expectations. i'm feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person...,0,Knits
I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other  looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching  thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc,0,Jeans
I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute  and the fabric is of nice quality. it's a very loose fit  which i would've been willing to work with  but... as mentioned in previous reviews  the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm  and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac,0,Knits
I agree with some of the other reviewers; this dress runs very large. when i tried on the xs in my local store  i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole  but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home  it was just too roomy and not fitted enough. i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better. it is an adoreable design  cut and color. it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it.,0,Dresses
Unfortunately  this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big  too shapeless.,0,Dresses
Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%  which you don't see often anymore!)  great length  nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch  but as someone with a small waist and wider hips  i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure  these might work better,0,Jeans
I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff  it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.,0,Blouses
I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.,0,Dresses
"Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me. where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust  truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am. same with the arms  if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams. i'm 5'6"" and a classic size 8 and this",0,Dresses
Dress was a disappoint. very thin and cheaply made  not worth the money at all. pictures make it look much better than in real life. top area is also made small so if you are busty  this is not the dress for you.,0,Dresses
Beautiful well made top.it just runs small not for me,0,Blouses
This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it's really beautiful. however  there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it's the style and i have similar style dresses  but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me.,0,Dresses
Lovely knit and so soft  but the bottom curls up underneath  similar to the bell sleeves. runs oversize too  got xs and it's too bulky and unflattering since the bottom doesn't lay flat. returned!,0,Sweaters
"It does run large as most reviewers noted. i opted for the pxs and it was still very large and the way that the elastic at the top hit me it bunched funny and made my chest look huge and i'm only a b cup. it added a good two cup sizes to my chest and it just looked odd. the length of the petite was good for me at only 5'4"" so the length did not overwhelm but the width was still really too wide. love the fabric and the lace at the hemline. it just wasn't for me but for those it works for it is be",0,Blouses
I ordered this on sale  after reading the review  but i was disappointed when i tried it on. the color is darker in person  which is better for me  but it looked dull on my skin tone (pale). also  teh sleeves poofed in a weird way on the top where the seam meets the neck. the overall cut is almost flattering  a little long still for me in petite  i felt like i was trying on a regular size. so not for me. for reference  i ordered the 0p (or xsp  not sure right now). i am 115 lbs  30dd chest  26.5,0,Dresses
I really wanted to love this dress. i love the colors and the design of the dress. unfortunately  i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant. it's so voluminous that it's not flattering at all. also agree that the lining is scratchy.,0,Dresses
I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle  so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198  in my opinion.,0,Jeans
I wanted to love this  as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.    but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there  a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part  between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look  and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.    the fabric  though nice quality  has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch  but i'd just say,0,Dresses

I love the idea of this shirt  but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off  but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br,0,Blouses

Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s,0,Outerwear
Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however  when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however  this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey  which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.,0,Dresses

These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren't unsolvable so try them out!,0,Jeans

This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.,0,Dresses
I read the existing reviews  before purchasing  and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large. this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer. i figured by ordering a medium  i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater. this was not the case! the sweater is short  does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind (and i assume the model is taller than i...as models are usually tall). for reference  i am 5'6''  medium build,0,Fine gauge
I loved this dress when i saw it online  perfect for a summer wedding  but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely  it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly  it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.,0,Dresses

It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline  but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.,0,Fine gauge

I'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small  and i'm always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color  and i'm sad that they are so large.,0,Pants
I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color  the quality  the style  but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work  but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun  but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely  and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.,0,Swim
"The dress fit fine  with two exceptions. first  i am 5'1""  and i ordered a petite 4. the dress was dragging on the ground  so it would need hemming if i were keeping it. but the deal breaker was that the gathering of the outer fabric over the bust stuck out an inch beyond my 34d figure  which made me look like i had very oddly shaped nipples. i made the assumption that the dress i received was defective  so sent it back  but unfortunately  the replacement fit the same way. the lining fabric fit",0,Dresses
Based on the other reviews  i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p  but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn't work. i can't imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure.,0,Dresses

I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer  but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body  which made my waist look thicker than it is  i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice  but i still didn't buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw,0,Dresses

Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style  but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width  and with the peplum style  extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely  it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top  then this is perfect  but if you wanted something that hangs nicely  look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s  my typical size.,0,Blouses
First  i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics.       what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that  although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin,0,Blouses
I took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs. i am 5'6 and 110. i could take them off without unbuttoning them  they were hugh  even the xs! they looked like a halloween costume. even at the discounted sale price  awful and kind of made me laugh. but i guess that's why they are still available at this sale price.,0,Pants
I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however  the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally  at 5'8  130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.,0,Pants
I probably should have gone with petite. this dress was just awful on. the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be. it hits me about thigh level. it's very unforgiving  clingy  and shows every bump. i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time  i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy. it's going back.,0,Dresses

I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu,0,Fine gauge

Loved the color! loved the scallops! wish i loved it on me. the poplin fabric is very structured  which doesn't lend to a nice drape. the bottom hem was a little small for my curvy hips  so the top rode up a bit on me. looks lovely on a straighter figure  but wasn't amazing for me.,0,Blouses

I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.,0,Fine gauge

I like this top. it went well with my olive pant. i tried in l and xl. l was a tad fitted around my tummy. xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low. i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just didn't work. i am busty  perhaps it may work better for a slender frame. i recommend this top because it is pretty  but the fit is selective  so its best to try out a couple of sizes first.,0,Knits
I ordered this turtleneck in white and was very surprised to find that the material is so thin and gauzy it's sheer. i will definitely have to wear a white camisole under this every time i wear it  even when using it as a layering piece. it seems to run true to size if not a little small. the neck is interesting because it is so light and floppy...you can adjust several ways. it doesn't hold form well  though. i will most likely keep it but will never wear it without something both under and ove,0,Knits
I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers  i didn't find that the top fit small  but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls  but i'm very tall and broad shouldered  so it didn't look as good on me.,0,Blouses

Took another reviewer's advice and sized up to an xl. unfortunately it grabbed around my midsection and wasn't attractive. love the color. and it's dreamy soft. the sleeves are attractive on less than toned arms. my problem was with the side view which emphasized my tummy (it clings) and you could see a lot of my bra because in the larger size the armholes are large. sadly returned.,0,Dresses

I loved this dress especially because each flower appliquã© was so beautiful. however  each attached to one another by single threads. given that i wear lots of rings  i could already tell that i might snag these beautiful flowers. additionally  the appliquã©s are sewn so close to the back zipper that some of the flowers were already getting damaged from the dress being tried on. overall  if you are very careful  this is an amazing dress  but i did return it because of its delicate nature.,0,Dresses

I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so  it's too big but the length works)  or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable  and the design is different in a good way.,0,Skirts
I was thrilled to find a wide-legged pant in a natural fiber and ordered two pairs - l and xl. the l came first and was a tad too close for comfort so i returned it. when the xl arrived it seemed roomy but after my first wear the fold-over jersey knit waistband stretched out and the pants were dragging on the ground. they seem really huge on me and i now have to wear a belt to keep them up. the fabric also seems to be pilling easily- overall not my best retailer purchase (and i am a huge fan,0,Pants

I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad  because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...,0,Sweaters
I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight  sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big  so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first  but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2  4  6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details  but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's,0,Pants
When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions)  the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item.,0,Knits
Absolutely love the print and quality is great too! unfortunately  for a well endowed woman like myself  it runs terribly small in the bust and hip region. it absolutely does not look as flowy on an hourglass body type. too bad because it's beautiful! might try sizing up but doubt it will work :(,0,Dresses

Very pretty dress. the color is much brighter in person - a little too bubblegum pink for me. i love the way the bodice fit but there was just too much material in the skirt which made me look hippier than i am. would have preferred the skirt to have more of an a-line cut,0,Dresses

This dress is cuter is person than online  but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or  maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.,0,Dresses
This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it  and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide.     even when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant  the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i'm back to about a size 10-12  this looks like jared from subway's pre-weight-loss pants  in sweater form. ridiculous!,0,Sweaters

This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer  but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest  cutest tees  but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.,0,Knits

This dress was as pretty in real life as the picture. flattering also. unfortunately it is definitely not appropriate for office work. even though it appears so in the picture  the back is very low cut and there is no way not for bra to show (unless you don't need one) also it was much tighter on top than the model picture  even though the rest fit perfectly.,0,Dresses
This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on  it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side  gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also  it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.,0,Knits

I wanted to love it  but it's pretty pricey for a sweatshirt & the key hole in the back with the bright pink ribbon just looks odd. the stitching & beaded detail around the bottom hem & the cuffs is gorgeous  but the sleeves were way too long on me and just looked silly. unfortunately this will be going back.,0,Knits
I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,0,Intimates

It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small,0,Skirts

Really wanted to love this  especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top. when the top arrived  the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace didn't completely cover my black strapless bra (and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest). thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable. i did love the length of the top though. wish this top was a keeper  but going to have to return.,0,Knits

Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length  but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well  everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item  but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!,0,Blouses

I love the look and fabric of this skirt. it also falls at a very nice  flattering length around the knee. what did not work for me was the waist. the stretchy waist looked cheap  and i do not have a flat stomach  so it made me look like i have a muffin top! i bet it would look great if you have a flat stomach.,0,Skirts
I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight  and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it's a bummer.,0,Jeans
I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand  my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top  so hoping i'll end up loving it!,0,Knits
Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric  but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining  and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.,0,Dresses

Sadly  i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest  so sizing up was not necessary  but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!,0,Knits
I saw this top online and had to buy it immediate (which is rare for me). it looked loose and forgiving but had a polished look. it didn't disappoint when i tried it on. however  the straps are a bit loose and will need to be altered. the linen fabric can be rough or itchy  but still a gorgeous top!,0,Blouses

So sad that this cardigan did not fit me. i listened to the review i read and tried a small  didn't come close to fitting. i tried a medium and it also did not fit. i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame. i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest. i usually always fit into a size medium.that being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine  has an interesting design and is well made. so sad this item didn't work for me :-(,0,Trend
It seems like most people love this tee  so you might as well. i returned it because i didn't like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back  i would have kept it. or  if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants  untucked  i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material  though. it's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it,0,Knits
I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest,0,Dresses

I thought this top looked adorable. and the material was soft. tops like these don't usually look great on someone who is a little bit busty  it can make you look fat or like you're wearing maternity. but the real issue was the arm holes were large and seemed to gape a bit. it just didn't look flattering. even if you wore a cute  lacy bandeau bra  the way the material sticks out around the arm holes would still look awkward. too bad  since it is a cute top  and well made.,0,Knits

So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what  but this did nothing for me. the bottom  which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person  just not me.,0,Pants

If you're tall  this dress sits up too high-waisted and this makes your waist look big. it's also kind of thin material on top and stretchy  so even though i'm small chested it made my shoulders and chest look large  but not on a good way. in other words  this dress made me look fat. the length is not bad for taller gals. all in all  not worth it.,0,Dresses

This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.,0,Sweaters

This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine  while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.,0,Knits

The sweater runs large  the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however  the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater  but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly  you're a genius.,0,Sweaters

I saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on. the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous  i could not wait. when i tried it on  it is such a loose top and a tad short. it was flowy all over. i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this. it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings. i don't recommend it for a curvy figure  just not flattering. makes everything look big. what a waste because the print is so nice.,0,Blouses

I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so  but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no  retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice  the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress,0,Dresses

I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made  hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.,0,Dresses
The picture of this top is misleading. it's more like a tent/ super short dress. i ordered my usual size (l) and could easily get away with a small in this top  if the arm holes were not too tight. i def. need to go down to a medium  and maybe even a petite medium since i'm 5/3. the top is 100% cotton  but there is so much fabric there is no way a little shrinkage would offset the amount of extra fabric. it looks like a tent on. plus  the picture and description make it seem like a normal top le,0,Blouses

I loved this top when i saw it online. i was able to go in the store and try it on and sadly  it is not the top for me. if you have a large chest  then this top will gather at your cleavage and give an awful appearance. the fabric falls in and even the sales associate agreed that it was unsightly. if i were an a or b  this probably would have worked. i should have known to stay away from a pleated top.,0,Knits

I had mixed feelings about this dress. the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd. it has two slips  one that fits close and a second that's a bit too puffy. so the skirt didn't sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger. the odd length made it unflattering. it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i didn't want to risk it.,0,Dresses

First  the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green  it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds  whites  blues  pinks...virtually any color.  the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice. they do seem to run a little large  so i'd size down if you're between sizes.  and now  sadly  the bad: these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a,0,Pants
"I bought the orange color. i had a hard time styling it as it is so long. since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve  you'll need a jacket or sweater on top. nothing looked right. it has a relatively high and tight neck  so sweaters looked weird. short jackets didn't work either. i'm 5'4"" and bought the small. returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better",0,Knits
But  it just doesn't measure up. first  the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and  once on  the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately  i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute  but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.,0,Dresses

It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did,0,Blouses
I ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design. the blue was much more of a dark navy  not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture. the picture also shows it tying on the side. it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress. it was not at all flattering on me. one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer.,0,Dresses
Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour  the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips.,0,Skirts

This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.,0,Knits
A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics  scarves and jewelry. so  i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses  even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived  i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes  so it is going back asap.,0,Jackets

I like this top. in the photo  the white in the print stands out. in-person  the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull  more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good  the print looks good. it is a swing top  looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down  could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.,0,Blouses

I purchased the sand color (beige/) one size up from my usual xs to allow for extra room around the hips. the dress fit a little large so the extra room wasn't necessary. the fabric was much thinner than i expected for the price point. the dress was sheer and on my lighter skin tone looked more like a lab coat than a dress. this may be stunning on someone a bit taller. at 5'4 it just hung on my frame and didn't do much for me. the pockets are a nice touch but overall the cut was unflattering and,0,Dresses

I love the design of this sweater and ordered it online  but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived. also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo  still a type of ivory  but a little yellow-y. the sweater was solid looking  but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i'm not sure how well it would have worn over time. flattering cut. i liked how it fit  but for the price and fabric  i decided to return it. unfortunate to lose money on shipping.,0,Sweaters

I chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure  but was disappointed. the fabric is a beautiful soft  fine silk  but unforgiving. the cut is not truly a wrap  and  with a fixed thin elastic waistband  was too short waisted for me. while the model looks elongated  the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections... not flattering at all. while i was drawn to the shape for my body type  it may be better suited to another. happy hunting!,0,Dresses

I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly  there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.,0,Dresses

I ordered my normal size in this dress. i am 6 foot tall  but the regular sizes were too large and too long (mid-calf). i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline. the dress is lovely  especially on the models in the pictures  but didn't quite work out for me. also  it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time!,0,Dresses
This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.,0,Sweaters
I loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail. as soon as i put it on though  i was drowning in it. i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it. i still really like it and wish it would have worked. i am 5'5  athletic/slim figure just for reference.,0,Outerwear
Let me start this review by saying  75% of my clothing is from retailer and i love them. my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it's gorgeous  but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other. i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue. sometimes is was extreme  sometimes is wasn't as noticeable. it was noticeable to me  however  as i am 6' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short. love the sweater  as it wa,0,Sweaters
This top is gorgeous and beautifully made. however  the fit leaves a lot to be desired. the other parts of the straps pucker out and do not lay flat on your skin. i tried to make this work but just couldn't  so it's going back.,0,Blouses
I bought the white tee. while the print is nice  the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).,0,Knits
I don't know if i was sent a petite by mistake  but this is not 39 inches long. i realize it says swing dress  but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough  the weight would make it flattering on me. as it was in reality--short and light-weight fabric--it poofed out in an unattractive way. too bad  as the print is lovely.,0,Dresses
The colors on this top are beautiful  even more vibrant than the online picture. i was so excited to try it on. the problem is with the fitting. it's too short and too loose. you can see in the picture that the shirt isn't even tucked in and it barely hits the hips. as much as i wanted it to work  back it goes.,0,Knits
I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment  it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.,0,Sweaters

I ordered this online and i love the style  but didn't like the print as much as i thought i would.,0,Dresses
I really loved this top. however  i couldn't get it on. i tried on a medium (my usual size.) it's not that it was too small. something else is wrong with it. the large was way too big. too bad  i really wanted this look.,0,Knits
I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses  but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me  and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!,0,Dresses
"This top is a tough one. i ordered my usual medium. i'm 5'7""  165 lbs  34c  and wear a 10/m pretty much all the time (tops and bottoms). let's begin:  the bad: when i tried it on  i found the bust to be too small  and the darting on the sides puckered in a very non-flattering way. the ruffle at the neck stood up more like a mock turtleneck (which is not my scene). also  the fabric seemed a little thin for chambray.  the good: the pattern is adorable. the sleeveless design would be great under bl",0,Blouses
Such a great dress. fit is flattering. the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd. classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes. thrilled with purchase!,0,Dresses
This top is very nice. i ordered it in black  it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric  however  feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable  it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton  i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.,0,Blouses
I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model  but on me it looked tacky.  i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs  and this dress hit me in all the wrong places.  i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large).  i wish this were just a little bit a-line.  instead  it's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.,0,Dresses
There is nothing special about this skirt. it's plain and incredibly dowdy looking. long and wide. i am usually between a small and medium. after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium. it fit fine in the waist/hips.,0,Skirts
I ordered this in size xl and it ran small. i'm a pear-shape and thought this style would be flattering. i have a few other peplum-style sweatshirts from retailer that are my favorites. but  the cut on this is tighter so the bottom layers gap and don't flow well. i found it to run short too. it's cut one size too small. i would have sized up but  being xl  there's no option for that. i'm returning mine.  the applique is done well and is cute. the colors look the same in person.,0,Knits
The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip  it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn't see through i would keep it.,0,Skirts
"This shirt arrived today  and i was surprised how short it is. not a tunic at all. i wonder if the lengths on these vary  and if i order it again  it would be a different length. i ordered my normal size  xs petite. i'm 5-2""  so this should have been a tunic on me. perhaps if i see this shirt in the store  i'll try on the regular length. i'm returning the petite!",0,Knits
I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays  the length  the material  etc. what i don't like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it's warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad  i would have bought it for sure.,0,Blouses

Like the idea of this shirt so much. but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible. wishing the under layer really covered as no way i'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt. might just be my body type  so might work for someone else  but sending back.,0,Knits

I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous  but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants  and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.,0,Pants
I really wanted to love this dress. it is absolutely beautiful - the color  design and details. however  whether it is the high neckline or the sleeves  it did nothing for me and made me look kinda frumpy. though i am slender  i have a chest. maybe that was the problem.,0,Dresses
This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn't a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall  the cut and style is cute  but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric.,0,Knits
This top is very strange. i agree with the other reviewer in that i think it's not cotton. it clung and got bunched up around my chest. like in a static cling way. there's just something about the way it hangs that is not flattering. too bad as i was really looking forward to wearing this but alas  it's going back.,0,Knits
Really liked this dress  but it ran too big for me.,0,Dresses
This top looks good on model and has great reviews online. however it did not work on my bodytype. when i tried it the slit in the front sat too low. i don't like showing cleavage because i dress conservatively. other than that i would have loved wearing it. arm cut is not too big such it shows sides of bra bands. overall fit is loose and drapery.,0,Knits
I really like the dress  the material  the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun. however  the neckline is a bit to low  and a cami is necessary  at least for me. the material is very sheer  which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee).the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off. there are no zippers or buttons. getting it on is easy  not so when taking it off!,0,Dresses
I really wanted this to work. the embroidery detail is very pretty. however  the inside of the sweatshirt is a bit scratchy from the embroidery so i would recommend wearing a cami or tank. the sweatshirt is also on the short size. the small hit the top of my jean waist. in the end  i decided to return it:(,0,Knits
Great color  soft fabric  but waaaaay too long. more like a night shirt than a t-shirt.,0,Knits
I love the way that this suit looked  however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on  that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine  but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.,0,Swim
I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didn't work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me.,0,Dresses
I was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants.,0,Jeans
Really cute sweater  well made  but so intensely itchy i couldn't keep it on for more than 30 seconds !,0,Sweaters
I found both colors and jumped on this shirt. then i got it home and realized that it was pretty much useless. there is no way to put a sweater or jacket over it  it is too hot to wear in the summer  putting a tee under ruins the look.  i am very flat chested so it hung well  but there is lots of shirt. both went back in exchange for two wearable items.,0,Knits
I love the colors and style of this poncho  however  the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy  i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also  unfortunately  the fabric is not woven tightly  so the poncho does not keep you warm  the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top  the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back.,0,Outerwear

This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small  very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust  maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.,0,Dresses
I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric  it just wasn't flattering on me.,0,Blouses
This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though.,0,Layering
I bought this dress because it was cute  swinging and lightweight -- seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer. after on wash and dry  the dress is already ripped around two buttons. i'll still wear it but i don't think it'll last until next summer. kind of pitiful since it wasn't a cheap-o dress. also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point.,0,Dresses
I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.,0,Swim
Like some other reviewers  i  too  have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself  i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust  and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps  i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool  and i was rea,0,Dresses
"It's such a beautiful skirt  i kept it around and tried it on with every top i own but i could not get the right look. the waist ""poofs"" out right below the waistband so any shirt worn over it makes you look frumpy. tucking a shirt in didn't look right because of the poof. it doesn't do anything to flatter a figure. the skirt itself is gorgeous. for the price  i need to make sure my clothes make me look good too! reluctantly i had to return it. i was hoping it would be my summer go-to skirt.",0,Skirts
I ordered the petite in my size  since i'm well petite  but curvy. i recommend this dress if you don't have a lot of boobage. unfortunately  for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits  but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.,0,Dresses

This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy  loose-fitting tops  but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.,0,Blouses
This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all  the armhole is way too low! second  there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper  it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.,0,Blouses

This is a fantastic dress for fall  if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l  rather than in particular dress sizes  so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give)  but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo)  with a tightness at the clavicle  and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.    i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season ,0,Dresses

Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft  the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it's a bit short in front and also boxy  which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it.,0,Lounge

Unfortunately  this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8  130lbs  and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also  while the dress is lined  both layers are quite thin- not see through  but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material  it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.,0,Dresses
I bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them! i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket (basic goody binder)  and there is a circle stain where the binder was! so strange! i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them. the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them! they are ruined! i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them!,0,Pants

Purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on. when i got home  i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right. i took them back and tried them in the next size. they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me. i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either. i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online.,0,Pants
Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole  but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back  even with the sale price.,0,Blouses

Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view  the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure  so while the look as you approach walking,0,Skirts

First  the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top  but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs  and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.,0,Blouses
At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because  in person  the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration  there is a surplus of about 16 inches.    the material is still beautiful. and because of that  i haven't decided whether i'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner  more fitted shape.,0,Knits

I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work. the fabric is gorgeous  but the fit was very unflattering. it's too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes. i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise. in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn't compensate for the very unflattering fit.,0,Dresses
The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate. but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used. although figure flattering  the zipper is so cheap that --it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress. and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they're asking for it. maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail,0,Dresses

There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.,0,Shorts

I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.,0,Dresses
I loved how soft this dress was  as well as versatile. however  i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash  a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately  the fabric is so soft  but rather thin  and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be,0,Dresses

I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body  however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve,0,Knits

I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans  as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans  they fit very well. however  for the price  they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose  even after 20 wears,0,Jeans

I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts  length is fine...the inside is some  but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.,0,Jackets

I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand  i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me  they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also  the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale  but even at $50 i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but,0,Pants

This romper is cute. i won't deny that. however  the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas. i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly. however  the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders. i'm short  but have a little wider shoulders  so  perhaps that was the issue. it seems like another reviewer had the same problem. there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down  so  i had to do some cont,0,Dresses
The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on  however the material is thin and slightly see through. also  after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it  i discovered a large hole in the armpit  most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater.,0,Sweaters
Again  bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses. i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink  and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess  mid-vacation on the amalfi coast. i tried it on at home  and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top. since i'm not with child  this one's going back!,0,Knits

This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip  but the slip was tight  but the shirt fit  maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off  so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it  so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger  but still cute on and for a summer shirt  it's thin  so it does work well in that r,0,Blouses

The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband  mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips  they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue  i would keep the trousers  as they are comfortable and pretty  and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through  as i feared.,0,Pants

I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small  especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately  the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.,0,Blouses
Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.,0,Pants

First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,0,Trend

I was hoping to wear this dress for an engagement photoshoot but it fit terribly. i'm 5'0  98 lbs  32a  and have some hips/butt. this dress (ordered xxs petite) hugged my hip/butt region tightly  which made the dress ride up and balloon out around my stomach and back. there was also too much extra room in the chest  so sizing up was out of the question. there is just way too much fabric and it's very stiff with no drape or shape whatsoever. i felt like i was wearing a cardboard box. the sleeves,0,Dresses

Boxy  unflattering  and large.  i'm 5'2'' and a curvy 135 pounds. this top (size s) swallowed me  had no shape  and the material didn't feel great either. i wouldn't even purchase it on sale--there are other graphic tees that are much nicer. i'll be sticking to splendid and sundry.,0,Knits

I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.,0,Knits

"Nice weight and loved the design  but the inside was what i loved the most. it doesn't show in the photos  but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided  so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background. cute detail! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves. they were about 2"" too long...and i have long arms! there wasn't enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up. the only other option i came up with was to fold",0,Lounge

Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse  only to look at the tag and discover it's by maeve (go figure).  this top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though  and the sleeve concept is cute. however  where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed.,0,Blouses
I don't typically write bad reviews  but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me  and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small,0,Dresses

The fabric is beautiful  even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large  as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure  even though it's a lapel  and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs  and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad  as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.,0,Jackets

I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful  but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere  my shape got totally lost and i looked huge. the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me  as well. possibly great for pregnancy  because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway.,0,Dresses

I purchased the green dress in medium. i usually wear a medium. the fabric is pretty. shoulders fit nicely. sleeves were short in an odd length  but that is indeed pictured accurately. the body of the dress is very shapeless  billowy and wide  which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown. i considered altering the garment  by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward  but i decided to return the dress.,0,Dresses

It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin,0,Fine gauge

This is a lot shinier in person  and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size. there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side. due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band  it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.,0,Skirts

This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,0,Blouses

The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.,0,Knits
This dress didn't work for me for several reasons  but i knew i wouldn't keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms  which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.    on the plus side  the fabric feels great  and it hangs well.,0,Dresses
I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful  but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so  it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang  the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem  but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t,0,Dresses
I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me  it was too much. wish it worked!,0,Skirts
I own the essential slims and love them  so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t,0,Pants

I couldn't believe how fast this dress sold out when they were having the fall promotion; they had just put it on the website and it sold out in my size in a matter of hours!  i just received the dress today and really like the practicality of it.  you can easily dress it up or down and it still looks sheek either way.  what i didn't like about the dress was that the material is a little flimsy compared to how it looks in the picture.  i am on the fence regarding if i will keep it.,0,Dresses
If you have anything larger than an a cup  this shirt will likely not fit right. it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest. it literally runs right through the center of the breasts. what were they thinking? if it had been three inches higher or lower  it would have been perfect. for reference  i'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup.,0,Blouses

Very cute top and nice material  but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small  but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full  probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected. also  the arm hole is wide  so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt  which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit  but i'm not sure about this one,0,Blouses

This dress is very pretty and feminine but was unfortunatly much too large for me. i ordered my regular xs and it was swimming on me. i also found the embroidery to be imperfect in several places (unraveling) and the placement of the embroidered designs were uneven at the bottom of the dress  which threw off the flow. the largest medallion was off center in the front of the dress and gave it a crooked effect. the material is nice and the pockets are a plus but i returned it.,0,Dresses

I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts  and based on reviews  went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes  2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also  the skirt flares super wide at the sides  it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt,0,Skirts

Loved the bright pattern online and had hoped it had a similar fit to the tyla ts which i love. in actuality this was a lot boxier. the cut was shorter in length  too short for my 5'10 frame. the width was rather boxy and unflattering  particularly with the wide arm holes and flat cuffed sleeves. also the pattern looked a little cheap in person  way less spectacular than retailers typical gorgeous vibrant patterns. this is going back i'm afraid.,0,Knits
The fit of the top is true to size  but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy  but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail  i'm absolutely sending it back.,0,Knits

I saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute. tried it on and was delighted. the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look. the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice. i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly. i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 12 on top.     i bought the top and didn't notice until i got home that it is dry clean only! yikes. i hate that. this is a casual top to me.,0,Blouses

Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split  so any movement reveals most of your arm  shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes  i could wear a sweater or blazer with it  but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why  retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc.  but the split sleeves make it a no-go.,0,Knits

I so wanted to love this top. i first ordered in the medium because previous reviews said it ran large. i got the medium and it ran so small in the arms that i could almost not get it off with ripping it. so i ordered an xl hoping that would work. unfortunately it ran just as small i'm the arms and i had to return.,0,Blouses

I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp  that's out the window. this design is poor. for one  this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so  without a jacket  i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.,0,Blouses

Here's what i liked: great shape through body  cool empire waist. and good length loved the color  more rust than red. material was somewhat light which liked since i often get overheated in turtlenecks.  here's what i disliked: the sleeves!! the reason they only show the model with her arms against her body is because the sleeves are ridiculous. they are just too big and too flowy. they will always be in the way of everything and there is no way to roll or push up.,0,Sweaters
I really wanted to love this dress  but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite  and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless  and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric  great color combo  bad fit.,0,Dresses

This dress is so so cute. i ordered an xs and it was a bit longer in person than pictured but that's an easy enough fix since i know a good tailor. the problem is that the dress isn't lined. it's made of thin  see-through cotton so it leaves nothing to the imagination. for the price of this dress i would have expected it to be suited for more than just a bathing suit cover-up. without a slip underneath it (if you can find a strapless one) it is unwearable in most social settings. it's such a sha,0,Dresses
I always have to try on tops of retailer. i know this  and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway. i don't think i'll do it again. the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly. ironically  when i washed it (according to directions) it also shrunk quite a bit.,0,Knits
The first surprise is that in person  the material is actually kind of woolen? at least  i would definitely call it a winter knit. the colors are also a little different -- so much so that i didn't recognize it in the store. i'm not sure if the one i tried on was stretched out  but it definitely ran large on me. the waistband is elastic  so i would worry about is stretching over time. i would have been curious to see what the petite option looked like on me  as the regular version was longer tha,0,Skirts
I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but,0,Dresses

I wanted this dress so much  i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up  at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on  and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced  but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad  as it seems like it would be a nice,0,Dresses

As another reviewer pointed out  although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water  the color around the popsicles will bleed! this is extremely disappointing. i'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover  or that retailer will take this item back. would only dry clean this item.,0,Dresses
This is a beautiful top  however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are.,0,Blouses

This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out  the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.,0,Dresses

I have a mixed feeling about this cardigan.  on one hand  i like it; on the other hand  there are some minor things i do not like.  first  i love its knit pattern; especially the pattern on the back.  second  i like a soft color of this cardigan.  on website pictures  two motifs look almost the same.  in reality  brown motif is light pink-ish while blue motif is light blue-green-ish.  third  texture.  this cardigan is made of linen and cotton  so it feels comfortable to wear.  if there are flaws,0,Fine gauge
I saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself. i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light. i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips. i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape. if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it. it is beautiful.,0,Dresses

The way the back came down so much made the top look weird. i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much. also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture. so to me it was just a over priced odd top.,0,Knits

After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it  i loved the fabric and color  however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!,0,Blouses

Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero  it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this  but mind the size of the slip in the petites range  and also it is aqua.,0,Dresses

I love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it. i would have realized the front and back are different materials  which i am not a fan of. i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back. it's like a mullet  business in the front and party in the back. it's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though  so into rotation it goes.,0,Knits

This is such a cute design  but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big  it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back.,0,Blouses

I really like how this looks on the model  but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work  but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it  a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so  best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.,0,Knits

It just isn't that flattering on me. it looks kind of old and dingy  even though it's brand new. it fits fine  but doesn't do much to highlight my curves. it just kind of hangs there. the length is somewhat awkward (i bought the petite version). maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny  like the model. it's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front  which reminded me of maternity wear. it does appear to be pretty well made; top part is lined. overall it's not terrible ,0,Dresses
Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so  so boxy - i'm thin  but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so  i had to return this  despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.,0,Knits

Ordered these in 31p last year  prob could have worn a 30p  ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit.   this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.,0,Jeans

I really wanted this swimsuit to work and it looks really nice in person and good quality as well  but sadly the top is cut really strangely. in the photo shown of the model  it looks like a v-neck that kinda gives your boobs a little push to the middle for some slight cleavage. however  that's not how it fit for me. the cups have removable padding on this suit  and when left in  my boobs didn't even fit in the thing and it just looked really awkward in general. and with the padding taken out  m,0,Swim

My first complaint is  this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way)  you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top  or the fabr,0,Trend

I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it  no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim,0,Knits
The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering  flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp  stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.  dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to,0,Dresses

I need t-shirts  these seem cute. a small runs loose  but it's comfortable and it does fit. i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand's printed tees. if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist  because these shirts are cut generously  the little slits just throw the whole look off. i tried a few in the store  but left them all there.,0,Knits

I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.,0,Lounge

This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops  and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately,0,Blouses

I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color  and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though  the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back  but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though  so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top,0,Dresses
A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this  i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey  not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said  it's very pretty  i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder  and i'll give the xs a shot instead!,0,Fine gauge

I tried this dress on in the store today  and the armholes were so wide  it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom  and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front. while the dress seems like it will be really comfy  the arm cuts are so unnatural  i had to pass. i did try going down in size  and petite  and neither of those options worked to fix the situation.,0,Dresses

I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright  not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose  the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau,0,Dresses

Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick  stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer,0,Blouses

I should have exchanged it for a smaller size  but i wanted to wear it  so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14  and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this  size down for sure.,0,Lounge

Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit  you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me  it may work better on curvier figures.,0,Dresses

I purchased this dress for the second time: it is the gingham garden dress from 2015 that was blue and white. same dress  new name and color. generally  this dress is large overall and long. i wish i could have purchased the petite size. i liked it enough to have it in black and white. this time around i ordered one size down and fit is much better.  recommendation: order 1 size down from your normal sizing as dress runs large.  the quality of the knit material is soft and flowing.,0,Dresses
I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however  the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it isn't that obvious in the photos  but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me  and it was too expensive to keep something that's unflattering. too bad  if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.,0,Dresses

Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful  but it also stops the material from stretching  so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also  they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger,0,Trend

On me  thsi was ginormous  looked like a mu mu. it is pretty  but there was just too much fabric  even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice  and it looks pretty  but overwhelming. i will say  i think it would work on tail lean people  i have pretty muscular shoulders  so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier  no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try  just not for me...    ref: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.,0,Blouses
"Like the idea of this longer tee/tunic to wear with leggings but i found it not flowly enough in my regular retailer size ( small). fit on top but not really on the bottom with the side slits. unflattering how the slits hit me. maybe for some one taller ( i am 5'3"").",0,Knits

I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp  my usual size  fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model  it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me  but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder)  hopefully,0,Knits
I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress! when i received it  it looked nothing like it does on the model. the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled. if you have anything above a c cup  the top looks completely unflattering. i looked so top heavy in this dress! definitely not worth the price. so disappointed.,0,Dresses

I liked this top  i really did. i also liked the subtle shimmer. the fabric didn't seem as soft  but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back. you can see it on the model here  but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didn't look right. asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large  but here it is. the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader. i am sending it back.,0,Knits
Yes  it's a swing top  just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season. i find this silhouette unflattering on me  being top heavy  so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house. it also runs huge  with big gaping arm holes. the sleeves are cute and fluttered. the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer. it is a pretty boxy top  which the photo doesn't seem to capture. order at least a size smaller than usual.,0,Blouses

This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.,0,Dresses

I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.,0,Lounge

This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,0,Intimates

This sweater is extremely roomy. the cut is very wide - wider than it is long  the sleeves are dolman style  and the neck is a little loose. with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i wasn't wearing a tent  but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin  if you can. i'm keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i'm exploring funky town lately. join me at your own risk!,0,Knits

Very disappointed: runs small in chest and too long. the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail. i don't think  this dress is worth the price  it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze. i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion. put it back on the rack  and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer!,0,Dresses
I sized up based on other reviews which was good advice. i am typically a size 6 but sized up to a 10. the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing. it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidly...but that's not me. i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region. i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky.,0,Pants
This style of shirtdress usually fits me perfectly  however  this did not fit me one bit. the waist was too large  the length too short  and the hips too small. i was really hoping this would fit  since it's a unique color and the material is substantial but soft. i will be returning this.,0,Dresses

This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip,0,Dresses

The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting  but the dress on top was just massive  like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side  so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall  this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life  harsher red  blue  and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.,0,Dresses
I was expecting an ivory/white cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit. i am 138 lbs  36b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m. the sweater is at least 1 or 2 sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit.    the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them. also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes. not unpleasant but not as pictured. as,0,Knits
I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model's photos. it just didn't work for me.,0,Sweaters

Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.,0,Sleep

Very disappointed when i received this. the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful. beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that. first it is nearly a crop top. second  it is boxy and it's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky. third  need to size down 2 sizes. had to return this.,0,Knits

I was so glad to find such a beautiful item made in the usa. i knew the workmanship would be above average. the embroidery is gorgeous and makes these jeans so unique. i am usually a 24 in pilcro slouchy chinos  size 0 in most pants   25 in jeans so i ordered these in xs. the waist was at least 7-8 inches too large. they were enormous in every aspect of fit. no belt could possibly make these stay up. very disappointed . i would recommend an xs if you are a size 6 to 8.,0,Jeans

This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however  the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.,0,Dresses

First of all  this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.  second of all  the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.  not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning  but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!,0,Dresses

This dress is a potato sack! from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird!! and it's huge on me  so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not. also the fabric is strange  not at all what i expected. i'm so sad :( i was really excited about this dress.,0,Dresses

As the previous reviewer mentioned  the pockets ruin this dress. pockets  usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress  so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.,0,Dresses

I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty  but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said  the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater  so i'll probably keep it. however  it really didn't meet my expectations for quality.,0,Sweaters

I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person  it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall  it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon,0,Jackets
Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!,0,Blouses

I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did  i was very excited  in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately  neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows  making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod,0,Sweaters

I purchased this shirt online. i thought it would be perfect for work  but when i tried it on  i couldn't even button half the buttons. it is also extremely see-through  and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd. need to return  unfortunately. if the top came in other colors  i would return for a larger size  but i can't deal with see-through work tops.,0,Blouses
I'm an xl in retailer tops  and the xl fit as expected in this blouse. however  the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering. the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume. i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse. the blouse is a good quality  but there were too many other issues for me to keep it.,0,Knits
This sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous. i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere. the quality is nice. maybe sizing down would help. but the medium/large is going back. i am normally a medium.,0,Sweaters
Ordered the biggest size available  the large. the arms are so tight  i couldn't get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don't understand why so constricting in the arms. i don't have big arms  either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can't recommend. i'd pass on this one.,0,Sleep

I wanted to like this top  as the fabric was nice and thick  but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits  which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape  but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion.,0,Knits

Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece  but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless  thin  beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light  breezy  go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel  this might be good for you  but it's too thin for just about anything else.,0,Lounge

This is another one of those darned swing tops. i can't even with this trend. this shirt has such a nice print/color palette going on but it's ruined by the swing cut/henley combo- it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized men's night shirt/smock? i don't know  it was just not at all flattering. i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut. i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes.. this just made my,0,Knits

I really wanted to love this shirt. it looked so nice and cool for summer and i don't own anything purple. the color was really nice  very subtly feminine. i am a little too short for this style though. i am 5 ft. 1 inch  105 lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide. the side slits came up a little too high for my liking  but i easily could've stitched those up a bit and they'd have been fine. i think this would look great on taller women  but on me it looked like a dumpy sack.,0,Knits
I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well! however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.,0,Skirts
This is a very cute dress. it was perfect before i washed it. the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not  so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two. and since the dress is shorter i can't really wear it without using biker shorts  especially for the back of the dress since it's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything. i'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute  ver,0,Dresses

This looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it  but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.,0,Jackets

I order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large. i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed. the colors are more muted than in the pictures  a faded blue and orange that i didn't really like. return.,0,Dresses
This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area  which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra  my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath  tank  or bralette you are fine with being on display.,0,Knits
I'd been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews. when it went on sale i thought i'd try but it was like a tent on me. the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo. too bad because the color was gorgeous & could have been a favorite of looked like photo.,0,Blouses
I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,0,Shorts

"I just received this dress in petite extra small. for reference  i am 5""7 and 118 pounds. to answer the previous reviewer's question  the regular size of this dress runs long. if you want it to look like the one in the video  then order it in petite. i personally love the style and the material. however  the inside slip is very short with the petite given my height but this can be solved by adding a half slip underneath it.",1,Dresses
I'm. 5'2 and based on other reviewer's input  i went with a regular rather than petite and the length works well. the top is cute  but it billows out around the waist which isn't apparent on the model. other reviews mentioned that so i bought it anyway with that information and it's fine if you expect that. i'm a 34dd and find it to be a bit tight in the bust.,1,Blouses

They were sold out of the medium that i usually wear in tops so i got a petite large hoping that would work. it obviously isn't the ideal fit but it will manage. it's very cute  but the colors aren't as vibrant as they looked in the pictures. for example the red in the floral print looks more like a rust color in person. but i do like it and plan on keeping it. will look cute with dark jeans and brown boots.,1,Blouses

First i ordered a m. i'm normally a 8-10. the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg. the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole. i love this jacket but cannot keep it in its condition. hopefully i will make it to the store soon (there are none w/in an hour of me) and look before i buy.,1,Jackets
I bought this dress in a sm for a cruise i'm taking soon. i don't have much of a waist  kind of straight like a board  and this dress is very flattering on my figure. the skirt fits snug and the top drapes nicely over my waist. very pretty and flowy. i bought the multi color stripe dress and the vertical stripes enhance the beauty of the dress.,1,Dresses
This top is amazing. so soft and the off the shoulder part stays where it belongs. i'm usually a large but got this in a med. fits perfectly.,1,Knits
I ordered these online. i usually wear a 4-6 depending on the brand. i ordered the 6 and love the way they fit as i didn't want them tight. they have a lot of stretch and the fabric is nice quality.,1,Pants

I tried this dress at the store and fell in love with it but they only had the red dress (my size). trust me  the red is absolutely beautiful but i needed a black dress so i purchased it online. i just can't wait for it to arrive!  it fits perfectly and it's so classy.,1,Dresses
I like this top. it provides a nice pop to the fall/winter dark wardrobe pieces. the picture gives off a blue hue  but the top is black  kind of a dusty black. the picture also gives the impression that the leaves are turquoise  but they're actually more green. at any rate  it is nice addition to my very dark winter wardrobe. i cannot wait to wear it with white denim like the model and something in the green family. i definitely recommend it.,1,Knits
I debated forever about ordering this and so glad i did! the colors are so pretty. i got the yellow and it's slightly sheer but ok w/ a nude bra. regarding fit- completely tts imo. i'm a 8/10 and 38 c and the med is perfect. i am so happy i did not size up.,1,Knits

I was a little hesitant about sizing based on reviews-but my normal small fit perfectly. it is a little low cut for work-but with a scarf will be fine. i wish it was a bit shorter (hits just below the knees on me).but overall great. i have a fairly straight body type and think dress probably works best on this type. although if you were small on top and curvy on bottom i think this could be cute too. for the price point (with the sale) its definitely worth trying! i got the black and white-and i,1,Dresses

Well-made  gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person  which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great!

Just received this and absolutely love it! i tried the vienne cardigan in the store and i assumed this one would fit the same (since online exclusive)  which it does. this one though has the whimsical left grey sleeve with trees  a fence and sheep on the sleeve - very cute. it's a traditional knit design with a twist of modern design being the cape style. it is a bit cropped but fits well and the hood lays nicely. there were a few too many stray threads when i received that i needed to cut off.,1,Sweaters
What a cute top! i would say true to size. it is a pullover so i went with a 6  for easy dressing. the scalloped tank around the shoulders is unique and lays nicely. i would say the top is a lined in cut. not too swingy at all. a great length to be left out or tucked in. i can think of so many uses for this top  i may grab another to keep on hand. will be adorable with skirts or shorts.,1,Blouses
I didn't think from the photo online that the sweater would be quite so sparkly & gold! it has gold weaved in - so if the sparkly isn't your thing  beware. the sweater fit well although i didn't feel the neckline was quite as clean as in the photo above. also  you'd have to be careful not to snag on jewelry. it's a thin sweater material that may require a camisole underneath depending on the weather.,1,Knits
These crops are very well proportioned and fun. the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options.  i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have. i usually need to order cropped pants in tall  but these worked with the regular inseam.,1,Pants
It's thin  very. but i were a cute scrappy athletic type bra underneath and it's so cute!  it's a stink top  i pick a spot to tuck in around the from and let the rest flow.  aside from being a swing top  it runs large. i have 2 in xs and i'm a 34dd and i still have room.  i have it in faded red/pink and white and am buying blue too  love it!,1,Knits

I am submitting this review because there were size issues mentioned in some reviews. i generally wear a size 4 but often size up to a 6 because i'm a d cup. i purchased an 8 in this because of reviews saying it was small. trying it on   the 8 is fine but it does tent out a lot at the bottom. i think i may have been fine with the 6 because of that; it seems a little big from the back view.,1,Blouses

I loved the idea of the placement print around the neckline and shoulders and even the nape. the print transforms an otherwise basic t-shirt into an eye catching top. it lacked in the length department  and there was extra fabric under the sleeves that wasn't flattering just above the girls.    this is made by retailer brand postmark. i own several tops by this brand  and found that their printed fabric tends to fade out from wash #1. as is usual for postmark  the brand was not stated on the produ,1,Knits

Very cute jumpsuit  especially for those who want to ease into the jumpsuit style. it looks very much like a dress but is very flattering as a jumpsuit because of the wide legs. the pattern is striking and bold but not garish. it has a low plunging neckline so you may need a camisole underneath (i did!) even though it has padding for those who want to go braless. i purchased a 2p and it fit my 5'3  115 lbs frame perfectly. i would highly recommend!,1,Dresses
This is cuter in person than online. the scarf goes all the way around the neck and ties on the side as the halter. the whole top is soft like a t-shirt material. there is an elastic band at the bottom  but it's not too cinched so it won't cut into your waist- it just gives it a little bit of shape. it's a cute way to show off some shoulder this summer in a lightweight fabric. i'm looking forward to wearing it out at night with nice jeans or during the day outside. a good price for retailer,1,Knits

It's really not in my typical wheelhouse. i took a chance based on reviews. the shorts are long and roomy enough. and i love it with the long-sleeves. i somehow feel less exposed in it than i thought i would. i do agree with the comment that the material feels pretty flimsy for the price point. that's a bummer.,1,Shorts
This sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall. i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier - the fabric is pretty lightweight - but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season.,1,Sweaters
I didn't expect to love this dress.. i assumed it would be something i'd return. this dress is so cute on! i love how well it fit me and that i could dress it up for work with booties  or pumps and a cardigan or dress it down for happy hour or a baby shower. i ordered a small ( i am 5'4 and 130 lbs) and it fit me like a glove....good job maeve you did it again!,1,Dresses
This is a really cute skirt  and it seems well-made (good stitch-work and enough weight to the fabric that i'm not worried about underwear show-through but not too heavy for a summer skirt). i sized up from an 8 to a 10 because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum. also  the zipper doesn't lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the side--still looks great imo. i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt. color is true to,1,Skirts

"I've been buying pilcro for years. they are good quality  comfortable and wear well. my only complaint is (and this a general complaint of all pants today) is that these are cropped. i have a 35"" inseam. these stop well above my ankle but i love the color and the general fit. i'm used to having most of my pants (even those labelled tall) be too short so i don't mind it too much. i feel as though it runs a little big due to how much stretching that happens as you wear them. it's pretty much a tra",1,Pants
The photo does not do this top justice. if you pull the tie a bit  it shapes the blouse a bit. i have a few work tops from retailer that i treasure -- they look good  wear well  wash easily and drip-dry perfectly. this top fits the bill too. and it goes with navy  black or even wine-colored pants. grab one!,1,Knits
Adorable skirt but fit is definitely too tight like the other reviews before me    i am super petite 4 11 105 pounds the double zero and zero were just a little tight for me and a little too long ( both could fit around my waist which is a 24 but high waisted and tight not a fit around the hips)   if  the length had been above the knee i might have kept  the zero but they were both returned    great skirt in the theory  with the wrong  waste fit and length,1,Skirts
I really did not need another coat at all  but i couldn't resist. got it in green - it's dark and woodsy something robin hood and his merry men could wear in the forest to look and feel their most stylish. the structure is just right - this coat is soft  cozy and fluid  but also tailored enough to wear in a business casual environment... equally well-suited to wear on winter eve dog walks  to a football game  or at the coffee shop for a latte at an outside table. works with most of my wardrobe -,1,Sweaters

This dress is amazing! i bought this dress for my daughter for her college graduation. it fits like a dream. she normally wears a size 2 but i got the 4 which was perfect. with the slightly longer length  it is very professional but with the lace cut outs is great for a party  as well. it is very flattering and well made.,1,Dresses

I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it  it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.,1,Dresses

"I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could  it's possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 12 years of shopping there.  the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage  for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear)  the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch  the fit is true to size  the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6""",1,Dresses
This is the perfect pencil skirt! the pattern is flawless!  the top shown with it here online is outrageously expensive! i paired it with a lace turquoise top that retailer has in stores and you can also wear it with a wine colored top. i would not wear it with black because you just lose the stunning colors.  if you love fall colors this skirt is perfect!!,1,Skirts

The top is indeed a bit boxier than i was expecting  as the other reviewer found. it still looks good tucked in if you're concerned about it. the fact that it's sustainably produced in ghana was a big part of my desire to keep it too. really great to see designers producing clothing responsibly! i wish that how a garment is manufactured is highlighted more on this site because it definitely contributes to my purchases.,1,Blouses

I spend a lot of time on the retailer website. it never occurred to me to try this dress. a salesperson suggested it in the store and i tried it on. it is really cute on. i bought a thrift store denim jacket to throw over it. the only con is the sleeves. i am 5'3' and my arms are not very long. the bell sleeves are a little crazy on me  but they will be hidden under the jacket.,1,Dresses

Like other ladies have mentioned  this dress runs small in the chest and waist region. you must size up!  __________  pros:  - flattering fit and flow. hides lumps and bumps.  - cut at the neck and back is cute and didn't make me look chunky surprisingly.  - little red polka dots aren't overwhelmingly at all and add a nice retro feel.  - good overall length.  - usa made!  __________  cons:  - runs small in the chest and waist. i'm a 36c  hourglass  170 lbs and normally can wear a size 10 in tops,1,Dresses

I fell in love with the dress when i saw it but i was worried about a few things before ordering it. one comment mentioned that the slip underneath was tight in the hips  yet as a size 30 in pants the slip was still fine. the other concern was the length. i was worried that the dress would be very short compared to my height  however  it was a good length in the front and the back was came down longer than the front which helped the overall length. overall  i ordered a size 6 and it fit well in,1,Dresses

Okay  i am not that tall and don't have legs for miles  but i loving wearing a wide-legged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday. these pants are great because they are 99% cotton. the cotton is a nice weight (not too light) and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail. i usually wear a 28 in pilcro and that's what i bought! i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green  though it did look little green under the lights in the store.,1,Pants

I bought this top in pink today and it is a beautiful bright pink spring color. i did have to size down from my normal size six all the way down to a 2 due to armholes being being too big. i tend to have a chronic problems with armholes being big so not sure others may find the same problem however i typically size down to a 4 when armholes too big. plenty of room in body still but i lost some length. i do have a short torso so can get a way with this. aside from my armhole problem it is a gorge,1,Blouses

This dress just feels and looks amazing. i love how it isn't too short like a lot of new styles. i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter. i also love the plaid cuff detail. the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced. i got home and realized one button was missing. i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms  2 buttons popped off!,1,Dresses

What a great jacket. love the subtle windowpane design and the color blue is a nice denim hue. i chose my standard size i wear in retailer jackets on this in house brand. i wish though it was made in the usa as i have several other jackets by cartonnier that are made in the usa. thus jacket looks so polished with jeans to a denim skirt to a bottom that is similar in fabric and texture. very happy with my purchase.,1,Jackets

I ordered these jeans to wear to work since they are very dark and tailored. my usual size 26 fit perfectly  but they did have to go to the tailors since they were incredibly long  which is nice for those of you that need more length.given that i usually am in skinnies  i like how they fit singly on the hips and slightly flare out towards the bottom  but not too much. these will work well with a variety of looks  making the price tag well worth it.,1,Jeans

Once i tried this dress on i understood why the pricepoint was so high! it's very thick ( but not uncomfortable) and very well made. love the color and style of this dress  but as others have said  the model picture is deceiving. try it on in store to see if you like it for yourself! i'm curvy on top and bottom with broad shoulders and personally it was a no for me  i found other dresses that i loved more  this one was pretty but wasn't a hit for me.,1,Dresses

I ordered a size 6 and an 8 based on the review that said that the piece ran small. i fit both skirts but chose the size 8 as it was a bit looser at the hip and the length was better. funny though-the pockets on both skirts were sewn at very uneven areas on both. neither skirt had usable pockets as they were sewn shut at half inch intervals on one skirt (6)  and very uneven intervals on the other (8). i liked the idea of pockets which is one reason i ordered it-it is described as having side poc,1,Skirts
This dress was gifted to me and is a perfect compliment to the holidays. i can't wait to wear it! the bottom portions shines (i am a devoted lover of all things sparkle and shine) but it really stands out with the darker background. the pleats hide imperfections in body shape and would make a flattering dress on most figures. i also like that the top layer extends below the bottom one  leaving little extra sheer to tastefully show more leg.,1,Dresses
I love this sweater. as others have mentioned  it's not the softest acrylic in the world  but i can overlook that for the simple fact that it's adorable. i like the cropped fit- pairs perfectly with high waisted jeans/skirts. the embroidery has a sort of handmade feel to it without looking cheap. the slit up only one side makes it unique in my opinion. i did expect it to be a bit heavier  but it's a great layering piece and ideal for transitioning into colder weather. i may be biased because of,1,Sweaters

The only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is way too small in the chest if you have anything up there.i usually always wear size 4 dresses. not in this dress! this beauty is a full size too small. trust me it is gorgeous but there is no stretch. it needs a zipper . that said  i exchanged it for the size 6 and all the flaws that i've read in reviews disappear. the sleeves are better and it falls nicely and is comfortable. also  there is no lining. just good to know.once you get it ov,1,Dresses

Love the length  cut  & placement of pockets. the stretch has positive & negative consequences  though. minuses: easily wrinkled  grow 2 sizes within the day. pluses: comfy  bendy  they're designed to be more of an active short  so the wrinkles & give are quite fine (they only stretch in unnoticeable areas). if we're to repurchase  i'd size down--but i love the bright color  & comfort so much i'm keeping these as is.

Love the fabric and design of this dress  very unique and comfortable. it is not lined  which explains the lower price when compared to other well fashioned dresses. i wore it successfully with stockings and no slip and it did not ride up or cling strangely. the fabric is stretchy and form fitting without feeling tight. the ribbons that define the detail around the waist were a bit snug but we're not uncomfortable. they define the waist very well. i am 5'7'' 127lbs  athletic build and the 4 fit,1,Dresses

These are perfect for pulling off a finished look  proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands. the polyester material is substantial  lined and easy care. the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted. i plan on wearing these a lot this year!!,1,Shorts
This was an unexpected surprise. i love the material of this short sleeved (almost sweatshirt) summer tee. the entire design reads late summer stripes with a cozy twist! the first time i wore it made me realize how tricky it can be to wear stripes and this design deconstructs all my previous hangups!,1,Knits

This dress is so unique  and is high quality. it came nicely packaged  and unfolded with no wrinkles. i bought it as a cool summer dress for events  and it fits the bill. i wore it once  and received many compliments. the only issue  is that you cannot take even medium size steps wearing this dress. a side slit would have solved the problem  but that would not have deterred me from buying it. the straps for the slip underneath are great  so that i could adjust it so my bra would not show.,1,Lounge

Based on reviews  i was concerned that this dress would not fit in the chest area. however  i find that i have ample room there (i am a full c). it is a tiny bit tight in the waist  but not uncomfortable or unflattering. i will go ahead and say that it runs small for that reason. the straps are a little long on me and will need to be taken up. also there is no zipper so getting it on and off requires unbuttoning the buttons  so it's not fast.     overall quality is very nice and it is very prett,1,Dresses

This is a pretty blouse that is also very comfortable. i am always an xl in retailer tops  but i needed to go down to a large on this one. this blouse is cut generously everywhere  but going down one size was perfect for me. the fabric in the back falls from the shoulder blade area  so it has a very nice drape in the back. the sleeve cuffs and placket are some sort of cotton  so the cuff made a nice base to fold the sleeve around and up to the elbow. i wore a nude bra underneath  and i can't see m,1,Knits

I debating this dress for a long time. i just was hesitant because it is very form fitting. i think this dress runs true to size. after reading other reviews  i was debating ordering a 6 (i'm normally an 8). and i am glad i went with the 8. it is form fitting. the material is just absolutely beautiful and not stiff. it is a bit thicker  which will be nice in the fall. colors are true to the pictures shown and length falls as shown on model.,1,Dresses

This dress is as flattering as wrap dresses usually are. the x-small fits well (dress probably runs a tiny bit large as i go between a small and extra small)  though i did move the tiny snap at the neckline down as it fastened too high for me. the dress did snag slightly in one spot but overall  it is really very flowing and lovely on  with unusual colors that look nice with late summer tan and gold earrings.,1,Dresses

Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom  i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake  not sure if it's real leather.,1,Outerwear

I love this sweater. i didn't buy it the first time when i tried it at the store because the buttoned look created a bulk on one side and i thought that this was very weird. it might have been what i was wearing underneath that day or that particular sweater. but then at 40% off i decided to give it another try and i'm happy that i did. i bought the navy and i love the feel of the material. sizing down makes all the difference  too. i wasn't fan of the attached sleeves at first as they are made,1,Jackets
Received this dress for christmas and fell in love. the detail and fit is perfection. the buttons go all the way to the bottom of the skirt so no concern for pesky flyaway exposure should the wind blow. the detail on the arms w the buttons is also cute and i personally loved the longer sleeve that almost comes to my elbow - it's very flattering. overall a great little dress!,1,Dresses

This is the most intricate  delicate  beautiful dress i have seen in a long time! the pale blue  coppery brown  and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin  dark hair  and light eyes. unfortunately my normal size was far too snug  especially on my hips  and this is now sold out. the fabric has no give  so i would say with any curves  size up if you can find this beauty. i'm heartbroken to be returning it!,1,Dresses
When i first saw this online  i knew i had to have it. so  when dresses were 25% off  i grabbed the deal! it's perfect. it's super soft and an appropriate length. i love the bell sleeves-they're ultra feminine and slightly trendy  but not too much! i definitely recommend this dress! reference: 5'7  140ish lbs--size 27 in jeans  xs/s/4 in tops and dresses and the small fit me better than the xs.,1,Dresses
I have owned a lot of stevies in the past. the only problem with them for me has been the rise. i have always thought they would have been perfect with a bit of a higher rise. voila! these have the perfect mid rise (for me). they are really soft. too long for my 29 inch inseam. they bunch at the ankles  but don't drag. i would love for them to have a skinnier ankle  but i also think they're fine how they are. i bought my normal size. they may turn out to be a tiny bit loose after wearing them. t,1,Jeans
This dress hung so nicely on my figure (small up top  bigger in the hips) that i couldn't pass it up. the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos. it might run a little small...i'm normally an extra small  but it was a little snug in the arms. however  the small was too big  so i would suggest sticking with your usual size. the saleslady said would stretch a little. i would have loved to try a petite  but the store didn't carry petite sizes. it will be my go-to holiday dress.,1,Dresses

This is such a great top - it can be easily dressed up or down. i love my tops flowy  and this is just that! i have a larger chest (34d) and the flowy nature of it keeps it from being too short up front. even though it has eyelits in it  it can be worn without a cami underneath as long as you wear a good nude bra. it'll be a great sweater for all seasons. i'm even able to wear it to work. highly highly recommend.,1,Fine gauge
I was very nervous to buy this top  but because it was on such an excellent sale i went for it- tops like this usually end in me showing a ridiculous amount of cleavage or not being able to zip (i am a 32ddd) it past my waist. i ordered a small based on the other reviews and it fits perfectly! the wrap top is perfect and shows off my curves without showing too much. the fabric is very unique and the whole top is lined with a nice nylon/cotton blend so it is very soft and comfortable to wear. def,1,Knits
I was really pleased with this skirt. the lightness of the fabric is nice and the colors matched the photos. i was initially concerned that it might be stiff and uncomfortable  but it feels like it has a bit of stretch and offers some good movement. sometimes retailer skirts seem to run small to me  but this fit perfectly in my regularl size.,1,Skirts
"I'm trying to buy more basic  versatile clothes and this dress in gray is great for that. definitely runs large-- i usually wear an 8 and it fits in a 6p. i'm  5'5"" and the petite falls where it does on the model. the regular was unflatteringly long and sack-like. quality seems ok for the sale price.",1,Dresses
I wasn't sure about this dress because some of retailer's cloths can make a women appear older before her time. i have to say that is not the case with this dress. i ordered it with the green and mint patterns in my normal size 2. this dress could not have been more beautiful on. i'm 5'6 115lbs and it fit perfect. the colors really compliment my dark hair and fair skin. i won't even need sunless tanner. i highly recommend this dress and placed the designer on my list to try out again.,1,Dresses
"It's a pretty  low-key  no fuss skirt. i prefer the ivory color because the details are more visible (there are different designs in the same hue). the zipper is very thick and sturdy  a bonus. size 2 regular fit me well  the hem falls right above my knees (i'm 5'2""  26 waist  36 hips)  perfect for work and play. a touch of linen keeps the fabric cool for summer  but it doesn't wrinkle. for the price and the name like ""thera "" i expect more flair to match its mediterranean name. for those who do",1,Skirts
Overall: a super comfy dress that you can wear anywhere. short  petite ladies beware though; the dress does not hang at your natural waist like it shows in the model's photos. in order for me to have it sit at my waist  the dress was folded over and did not flatter.,1,Dresses

Never spent this much on a dress so it needs to be amazing for me to keep it.  i've never seen flannel patterns and colors like this. the details in the back are unique. but in the end  i decided to return because it's too long and although it fit fine in a size large it didn't look that great on me. the dress has an exaggerated drop waist that was too low for my short waisted frame. the fabric smells odd. i tried belting it but the pockets and back buttons created bulk.,1,Trend
Love the asymmetrical hem. waist fit snugly as in perfectly. it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well. a little stiff in the fabric. classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didn't feel like we could wear it all year round.  can't petite or 0p was great (115 lbs),1,Skirts

I love the style of this coat and the way it fits on the model. in reality  the cut is more straight. i was hoping for some darting and a slimmer silhouette. cinching the belt makes the coat bunch unattractively. if i sized down  i think it would look better but i'm concerned that my shoulders will not fit. the fabric is 60% poly/40% wool and a bit itchy where it's not lined. the lining is a jersey poly blend. the belt has flimsy ugly string loops that cheapens look of the coat. other than the b,1,Outerwear

Ditto on the oversized comments. am generally a large in tees and sized down to a petite large and probably could fit nicely in a petite medium. the stitching on the neck and front design are adorable. a bit long but great potential for layering to showcase the writing on the collar or cute design on the front.  think it's a keeper!,1,Knits
In true cloth & stone fashion  this product is incredibly soft and comfortable. i bought mine in petite small  but it will flatter a number of different body shapes and sizes. it's easy to launder (machine wash)  and it will work as a perfect piece to dress up or down  depending on how you accessorize the product. i can't wait to wear this while i'm on the go and traveling over the summer.,1,Dresses

This tee is super comfortable. it feels and looks like a well worn favorite right off the rack. although it only comes in s-m-l sizes and i wear an xs ( 32a/b  105 lbs) the small fits well. no gaping armhoes to worry about. the pics don't show that the tee does trapeze out somewhat but it is not to worry about. i purchased the reddish color which is a wonderful faded maroon shade. i will be getting the black one as well.,1,Knits

This is a great light  free flowing top for the summer. i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area  but if you are small busted  you won't be affected. it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer!,1,Blouses

These are really great legging style cords. you can wear them without worrying about covering your bum in my opinion! they are not too bulky at all which you might expect in a corduroy pant. they are a tad loose in the waist area unfortunately but fit me well in the thighs  so i don't think sizing down would work for me. i bought the bronze  and it's a very versatile color! darker than the picture  but still a good color. i feel it will be perfect for fall and spring especially. i'll wear it all,1,Jeans

This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering  but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all  it's just a very good design.   note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear  without being visible  into the sleeve when they are not being used. also  the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used  so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).,1,Lounge

"I was in my local retailer to scope out a different piece  when i spotted this very attractive  well-designed jacket. sparrow's jacket looks dynamite on. the scale is perfect for me; the high level of detail is ideal. i chose this over getting an oversized sweater coat: it felt like these proportions were most flattering on my body. it will be appropriate for work or nice casual events. i bought the medium  true to size; i am an 8 top  5'1""130#  34f. although i largely buy online  sometimes you ju",1,Sweaters

Wow im really glad i didn't listen to the negative reviews! in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops! the neck line i agree does need to be secured. i wish they would have added a snap. it's fine though as i don't mind sewing it closed. this top is worth it! i'm 5'2 108 lbs and small chested. so for slim girls i think this is perfect!,1,Knits
This dress fits true to size- i ordered an 8 and it fits like a glove. it is a bit shorter than i thought (i'm 5'8'') but will be perfect with leggings in the winter and for the weekend in spring. it is a nice weight linen  not too thin. the dots aren't white  they're more light blue. very cute dress!,1,Dresses

I've had great luck with items from sunday in brooklyn & this vest is another fantastic purchase. the color/fit match the photos. the material is so soft. i've worn it quite a bit since i received it and it hasn't pilled. it's washed well too. the braided part can be folded down if you don't want it higher on your neck. it will still lay flat & drape nicely. it's perfect for cold weather. i'd love to see this come out in other colors too.,1,Sweaters

I love this sweater. i found it in the sale section a few weeks ago but wasn't sure if it would be too bulky. it had a dark smudge on the collar left from someone or something. i thought maybe it had been left behind by others for that reason because the quality was so nice. thankfully  i washed it and the smudge came out.       i live in houston  tx and don't need to wear wool or cashmere sweaters for warmth. this is mostly cotton. it is well made. the sleeves were longer on me than the model ,1,Sweaters

I love this tunic! it's wool but the same kind of thin high quality wool you might find in a nicer scarf. colors are much nicer than they show up online. this is one you really need to see in person. the only drawback is that the material seems to snag easily. i returned the top at full price as it is just too much to spend for something i'll only wear a few times before no doubt ruining it. if you are not hard on your clothes like i am  this is a great find. i may repurchase it when/if it gets,1,Trend
This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online  but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day  the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted  and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length.,1,Knits

Must have - i splurged on the white style and red style; couldn't choose between the two. shape of shirt worked for me. the white style isn't too thin that you have to wear something underneath. costly for the quality of fabric  but i had a gift card  and it is retailer after all.,1,Blouses
Ok  the material is great  light & airy. the thing they don't show you is the waist line is tucked in the photo  that's why you cant see the bi level hem line. the hem line is fantastic. the waist is the problem  the whole dress just hangs huge from bust down. the material is so light i would caution against darting the dress. i created a button loop cinch under the outside corer of the pockets  on the seem of the waist. this worked for me.,1,Dresses

"I am 5'0""  109lbs  32d  and the 0 petite fit tts. the fabric is comfortable and the dress well made. my only complaint would be that the picture of the model and the dress i have in my possession do not have the same coloured slip. my dress arrived with a nude slip. i was a little confused at first but when i tried on the dress i realized it was not a bad thing. the lace actually stands out. all in all  a greal buy. discounts make it worth it too.",1,Dresses

The sweater coat would be wonderful for cooler weather this fall. i ordered it in medium because the small sizes were sold out. sometimes a medium is the right size depending on the brand. i was disappointed that the coat was so large; i don't think it will work for me even with layers underneath. it's a great design but i may have to return it.,1,Sweaters

The embroidery is breathtaking. it is more flattering and interesting in person. i would highly recommend it!. it is true to size  figure flattering  and unique. the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy. if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece  this is it!,1,Blouses

This is a lovely  light coverup with a beautiful pattern  however  in the catalogue it appears blush pink when in reality it is white. the model must be wearing a pinkish swimsuit underneath the caftan giving it the allusion of being a color which it is not. i still like it enough to keep it but am disappointed that the item description did not mention this optical illusion.,1,Swim
I love the fit of these pants. 5 starts for that. i wish the pockets were a little closer together  but it's not the end of the world considering how well they fit. the real drawback is that the dye runs like no other pants i've had before. i had them on for a few hours and my fingernails had turned green and my skin was a greenish color. i am going to try to soak them in water a few times to see if that helps. i would still recommend these pants  but wash them a couple times before you wear the,1,Jeans

This is baby soft and a great basic. i ordered my normal size large and it clings in an unattractive way so you might want to size up for a better fit if you're not going to wear it as a layer. the black color is saturated in a good way. it's also very long but i'm short so this would be perfect for taller frames.,1,Lounge

I was attracted to this sweater because of the pretty fur collar and the color  which is a gray-black that seems to go with everything. the cut is a-line so it drapes over what you are wearing underneath. since the fabric is soft it doesn't add a lot of bulk and keeps the fit flattering even though it is not fitted. i have worn it many times since purchasing because the color and fit make it easy to throw on over your outfit for some additional warmth. personally i found that it runs very large.,1,Sweaters

I usually find maeve to run tts  but i sized down in this. i am normally a 6p and got an xs regular (to make the length more work-appropriate). i think a larger size emphasized the extra room at the front tucks - making it look a little maternity-like.  it is very flattering on - drapes nicely. i got the cranberry color for the holidays and will wear in with wine tights and light taupe over the knee suede boots!,1,Dresses
"I tried this on yesterday in the store because i was drawn by the rich purple color and pretty print. i took my usual size 2 (5'2""  110 lbs) and while it fit well  it did leave too much room in the bust and around the shoulders/arms. i had the store order me a 2 petite  and am confident that this will help. the shape of the dress is a bit straighter than it appears in the picture and it didn't gather in the waist at all  but i still found it flattering. i'm sure i will get great use out of this",1,Dresses

Fits well. true to size. love the kelly green color and found a blouse to match. the see-through part gives it some oomph and a little extra sexiness without being inappropriate for work. only downside is the beige color--kind of a funky bandaid-colored beige. but the blue and the green balance it out.,1,Skirts

"This sweater is much more brilliant in person. the photo online doesn't do it justice. a couple of things  the faux fur collar is removable and it is attached with buttons of the same color as the sweater. the color is also more buttery than it appears. it hits right at the hip  which is so nice for wearing with dresses or skinny jeans and boots for a night out. i am 5'3""  108 pounds and the xs hit me at hipline and was roomy without being oversized. it's really fun and festive with the collar ",1,Sweaters

I ordered this in size xl in the multi combo. the fit matches the photos. it's a strange sweater but i like it. i'm glad i got in on sale though. i'm pear-shaped and the curved hem fits me oddly. i like the longer length and the mix of blues/whites/peaches so i'm keeping it. it's not scratchy but also not soft. this is one of those purchases that i probably should return because i don't love it but i know i'll get enough use out of it to justify the sale price.,1,Sweaters

This was a christmas gift to my sister. she liked it so much she wore it the day after opening it. very cute design  lovely deep red color. only thing to look out for is the potential of fabric to snag - looks like it may do so easily if wearing long jewelry. may run a bit large  but the medium for her well (slightly loose fitting garment). she is 5'7 and would probably wear a large in a typical shirt.,1,Fine gauge

This top's subtle golden shimmer from the metallic thread used in the detailing is really nice. flattering  a bit special  all in all nice. but the white is see through  and the green somehow reads much more casual  at least to me. so a good top for times when your top being sheer isn't such a big deal but probably not for the office.,1,Blouses

I really wanted to like this since i've purchased previous byron lars dresses and have never not been complimented on them. however  the picture on this one is misleading. the colors are extremely bright  which on my pale skin makes me look washed out. for example  the border on the collar is actually more hot pink where in the picture here it appears almost white. the brightness and business just didn't work on me. that being said it still fit like a glove. 5'11 and 145 pounds and the size 4 wa,1,Dresses

Got this in the petite xs in mint; the color is gorgeous  it's a really bright mint that complements my super fair skin really well (though it would work for pretty much any skin tone). it's still a good length in the petite for the type of shirt it is (5'1 and hits right around my lower hips). it is a thinner fabric  but that's what i was expecting  and the lace detailing at the bottom of the sleeves is a nice touch and makes it more than just a plain henley.,1,Lounge

"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on  and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft  the pattern is subtle plaid  and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2""  34b  26 waist  36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod",1,Blouses
I took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat. i admired this soon as it appeared.  hesitant to purchase without any reviews  nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance.  i love the pattern  burgundy wine faux fur collar  the fit. colors are true. i sized up which i recommend. glad i did  this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate.  length mid-knee. imo not worth full price.  eleveness does design pretty coats!,1,Outerwear

Can't love this dress enough. i have to force myself not to wear too often. i get stopped every single time i wear it to get complimented. i'm usually a size 6 or 8 in dresses. went with the 8 after trying both on. i found the arms fit better with the 8. i'm pretty athletic and 5'5' around 140 lbs.,1,Dresses
"I've been shopping with retailer over 10 years and this is my first review. i almost didn't order after reading negative reviews from petite ladies. i'm 5' 2"" and these jeans are perfection! they look amazing with a 2-3 inch heel. i don't think they are meant to wear with flats since petite people look ridiculous in flats with boot cut or wide leg anyway. love these!",1,Jeans
The shirt is great  aside from the fact that it runs very large. i ordered an xs when i usually wear a s and it is still very big on me. the color is great though  and the fabric is more comfortable than i expected. i still wear it occasionally with pants or skirts that i can easily tuck it in to.,1,Knits

This is a fabulous cardigan/jacket!! i saw it on line and read the great reviews and happened to find one of each color in two different stores!! i bought them both!! i have practically lived in them the last week in rainy  cool weather!! the white one goes with everything  and the blue one in fabulous with jeans and probably other things as well. i have gotten several compliments on them immediately. they are just the right weight--not too heavy but heavy enough and a good sturdy  quality mater,1,Knits
I was not expecting the material to be as thick as it is. it has a wonderful drape and hand to it. i love the string tie straps so i can adjust it to fall on my chest a little higher. it seems that everything is too low-cut for my modest taste  but the ties let you decide how much cleavage to show. finding the right bra is always a little bit of a challenge with a cami  but i usually wear them under sweaters and jackets  so i'm not terribly concerned.,1,Layering
This dress fits so well  it is extremely well cut and flattering. the length is perfect (i am 5'5).  i passed on it though  because i didn't love the color. almost like a navy blue that has been washed one too many times. if this dress had more color options or made in a cute print i would not hesitate to buy it. if blue is your color go for it.,1,Dresses
I ordered both colors in size xl and they're each now favorite purchases. the fit is true to size--it matches the photos. the orange/white/brown/red combo works great with the orange version of the indra tassel necklace.  the tops are sheer so i wear a tank underneath. the green floral version will have some variations because of pattern placement. both are so unique & charming! i've been pairing them with different retailer cardigans & necklaces. they've washed well too--in a mesh bag on gentle &,1,Blouses
"Could not say enough great things about this jacket. nice quality and drape and such a wearable  comfortable option as opposed to a more structured blazer. nice  true to size fit (petite small was perfect on my 5'2"" 115 lbs frame--not too tight and not baggy  sleeves still 3/4.) will order an petite xs for my daughter  too. retailer  i would definitely buy other colors if you decide to order them.",1,Fine gauge

This jacket is just as stunning in person as online. high quality and just overall fabulous design. as much as i loved it though i couldn't get over the fact i was jingling every time i moved. it seemed like it could cause piling issues and i thought it might get annoying wearing for an entire day. i loved this and wanted so hard to keep it but i need functional chic pieces not noise makers. anyways fit was great looked just like the model on me so i would recommend but with caution as for this,1,Jackets
"Let me start off by saying that i really do like this sweater. the texture is very nice and  if it does start to pill  the material is one where i don't think it'll show up much (the fabric is a little ""bumpy""  but still soft).  i'm only giving it 4 stars because the sleeves could be 2 to 3 inches longer. i bought this sweater in both the red and tan colors (medium) i liked it so much. i've also never had a problem with long sleeve shirts/sweaters from retailer having overly short sleeves. however",1,Sweaters
I really liked this cardigan when i saw it online. when i received it  i liked the quality of the yarn and the tie on the back  but the color seemed dull and i didn't like the huge safety pin on the lapel. i tried to remove it  but it was sewn on and was worried that if i snipped it off the thread  it might unravel the yarn. had to return it.,1,Sweaters
This piece is almost what i want... i tried on the white version in an xs and it felt a little too large for me  even though it's meant to be a looser fit. the buttercup yellow behind the lace is very pretty - i especially love that part of this tank. it provides a nice contrast and allows the detail to stand out. the navy is also nice (it was on display next to the white and looks better in person than online). what i didn't like was the texture of the spandex on the back portion. it looks like,1,Knits

This is absolutely a 1-season top. the material is very thin and flowy  with the front v plunging pretty dramatically. i'm using mine as a swim cover  and i'm thrilled to report the mottled pattern on the cotton hides perspiration(!)  the first time i wore this top  i paired it with denim shorts  and the hemline completely covered the shorts  so it was way more of a mini-dress than a long shirt--which is ok. if i wear it again as a top rather than a swim cover  i'd just go with yoga shorts benea,1,Knits

These wide cut stretchy demon trousers are so flattering; i'm 6' and 160  which translates into curvy territory. i didn't need extra length  and the size 32 was bigger than i need  but not too big. these are very classy looking  and go with sandals to booties for every type of look  summer to winter   with a breezy top or a cozy sweater.    the revisitation of bell bottoms and culottes had me slightly down: those cuts are not the most flattering for most people. these jeans are smart but trendy;,1,Jeans

I've been eyeing this piece for a while and gave in when there was a sale. admittedly  i was first drawn away when i read that it was a pull on style  which always seemed cheap to me; however  it worked in my favor since the small was a tad big but the draw string helped cinch it (the store currently didn't have xs). the skirt  as shown on the model  seems like it'll be great as a transitional piece for autumn and winter (and when i tried it in the fitting room  i paired it with a cardigan and a,1,Skirts

Really liked the styling on this jumpsuit. it looks great on  the lattice back is unusual. i had been looking for a little black jumpsuit for the longest time and this fits the bill. just wish the fabric wasn't polyester. on the down side the top buttons are really hard to put on and take off. if you take care of your nails  it could do a number on them. the bottom buttons are easier. can only imagine a struggle when trying to take this off in an emergency bathroom break!,1,Dresses

This shirt is amazingly soft and has such a great cut  especially for me being curvy. i love to pair this with cute leggings or tight ankle jeans with my boots. recently wore on a casual date with the hubby and he loved it paired with my dark brown leather jacket and dark jeans.     only reason i gave it 4 stars was that the shirt tends to stretch out a little at the bottom is seems as you wear it throughout the day - it is still a great shirt and if possible i would buy more.     need to bring,1,Knits
I love this top- it's loose and flowy  yet flattering  and the colors are fun. the armholes are cut a little low  so a cami is necessary. after one wash and lay flat dry  the wrinkling is substantial. hope i can steam it back to its normal shape.,1,Knits

"I bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants. at 5'2"" the tunic felt like it added height and even though i'm a 34f the top fit well across the bust. i tried on the large first  and it felt very comfortable but a bit big. the medium fit a little more snugly  but was more proportional in the arms  so i purchased it instead.  the neckline is not too low and does not require a camisole under and the buttons add a nice weight so that the top drapes towards my chest inst",1,Blouses

Saw this dress in the retailer catalog and tried on in store. didn't need a dress but ended up purchasing as will be wearable for summer/early fall. seems like a print dress cut and style that will be used for many seasons. outer fabric is a bit delicate/may snag  and a bit wrinkly as another reviewer said  but works with the dress.,1,Dresses

Agree 100% with other reviews. this dress flares a lot so it does resemble a tent. to size down causes a problem in the shoulders. i had to keep the 8 - which is what i usually wear to accommodate my broad shoulders but i love it so much i am having it altered to taper and adding the pockets you would expect a dress like this to have. at this price i am hoping it's worth it.,1,Dresses

I have been admiring this piece for awhile and finally decided to purchase it  and i am so happy i did! the yellow is the perfect pop of color for fall/winter  but it isn't overwhelming or overpowering. fit is oversized (as is in any poncho style sweater) but it doesn't feel boxy or unflattering. if in between sizes  definitely go down. i like things oversized and i went with the xs/s and it fits great. this will be a go to piece for many years to come!,1,Knits

The fabric and design of this piece are so unique.  i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears  which is the case for this jumpsuit.  despite the extra volume  the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on.  there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless  though it doesn't seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid,1,Pants

This dress is so pretty and the fabric is tightly woven so that it won't stretch as much as other sweater dresses. i am disappointed in the sleeves though. the cut is way below the armpit so that when you raise your arms  it pulls tight and is uncomfortable. for the price  and the amount of time i wanted to wear it  it's not worth keeping. another thing is that the fabric is tightly woven so if you are cold natured and ok with the sleeve issue  this is the dress for you. however  if you are hot,1,Dresses

This is dress is great for an occasion - such as a wedding.    i wanted to keep this dress for such occasion - but there were 2 drawbacks. i ordered the dress online and when i opened the package  there it had some sort of oil/petroleum based product smell. the other drawback is the hips - it just flared out more than i wanted. i think that a belt would have solved that  but i usually don't find belts in my size.    as for the fit  it is true to size. i'm a true petite and the 00p fit great!,1,Dresses

I love these pants so much i had to write a review! purchased the carbon color recently in regular length - the length stated is pretty true and there was minimal shrinkage for me. size was also tts (typically wear size 2 and got 26). i've been wearing them often! they look great right out of the dryer and drape nicely. i've been purchasing the pilcro linen trousers for years but these are my favorites this season --- i also think the quality is much better. i will be getting them in more colors,1,Pants
I saw these sweaters in the store this fall and took a pass - they didn't look cute and i thought they wouldn't be cute on  because the little pockets looked droopy --but i was so wrong! once they went on sale  i took a chance b.c. i needed a black lightweight cardigan for a trip. ordered a size small and it fits perfect - so cute  i just love it! glad i bought it at the sale price because now i'm even happier!,1,Fine gauge

I agree with the other reviewer that the green is brighter in person  which was a happy mishap. the 8p makes this look just like depicted on me in terms of proportion  so beware that this borders on too long for petites. my not small chest made me look pregnant  but it fit well regardless. adding a wide belt made this dress look amazing on me and shortens it to a more flattering length. this is a miracle as-is because i'm very short-waisted. keeper!,1,Dresses
I cannot say how much i love this dress. i purchased it in mid-november and i'm wearing it for the 4th time this evening  which prompted me to write a review. it fits tts. the stomach area is slightly unforgiving  but due to the dark color  it's not at all a deal breaker. plus  it's a great dress to wear with opaque tights  which solve the tummy issues as well. what i love most about this dress is its ability to go from day to night/less formal to more formal. it looks great with edgy black ankl,1,Dresses

I saw this dress and was immediately drawn to it. the pictures others posted of themselves wearing it just made me want it more. i knew the color said ivory when i ordered it  but i wasn't prepared for how yellow it was. there is a liner/slip and it was honestly a pale yellow. it made the whole thing look dingy. i was so disappointed. if this dress was white i would've kept it. sadly i had to return. i am 5'1  around 135 lbs and i ordered a petite 6. i probably could've gone a petite 4. very cut,1,Dresses

This dress is definitely light weight and it requires a slip or you could wear a black tank and tights with boots. there wasn't a security tag in mine so no holes when i bought in store. i even accidentally caught it on a costume bracelet and it did not rip or damage. although  you probably wouldn't want to sit on concrete or rub against something rough. i would recommend this dress- its gorgeous on. for the price  i think it should come with a slip. fyi  the back half of the waist has elastic ,1,Dresses

I recently bought this dress in an retailer store  to attend an art museum event . the open back created an awkward bra exposure problem  which i solved by buying a gabardia camisole by lacausa (the same brand and print as the dress.) the dress is described as casual  but it can be dressed up with gold shoes or sandals.   the retailer saleswoman brought me the dara vegan leather jacket in plum  by hei hei to complete the outfit. the contrast between the airy dress and the vegan leather was chic and,1,Lounge

I just purchased this tank in white and blue. i find it to be soft and will be perfect for hot days but also can wear into the fall with a cardigan. it's super comfy but i do find at retailer that it's best to try things on in the store (it's hard to find perfect sizes online since things are cut so differently based on the designer). i got a large and though it's a bit flowy in the tummy area  it fits nicely across my chest (not tight).,1,Knits
I ordered size medium. the fit is true to size. the color and pattern work beautifully with the delicate yarns and design of this sweater. as other reviewers have stated  it is very thin and lightweight. in my opinion  it serves more as an accessory rather than it being functional as a cardigan worn for warmth. when i tried it on  i considered whether it would provide any warmth at all...summertime air conditioning  etc. the answer is no... if i decide to keep it  it will be for its aesthetic...,1,Fine gauge
I love these jeans. i am usually a size 27 or 28 in boyfriend jeans and i kept the size 28. i chose the baggier fit. the size 27 did fit  but it was a more fitted look. so i guess i would say you could definitely go with your regular boyfriend size and pick the fit that you prefer. i really feel like this is a jean that you should try on before purchasing  but the availability of these makes it almost impossible. i literally stalked the site so i could purchase both sizes and choose the ones tha,1,Trend

I was attracted to the colors when i first saw it...then i saw the back of it! the largest sz in the store was an 8.i had to order it  and got a sz 10. i then returned it for a 12 in order for it to drape properly in front. shorter than i usually wear  but worn with a higher waist bottom it fits nicely. and that back! not only is is striking  i am able to wear my regular bra under it  and the straps don't hang out.,1,Blouses

I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green  but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms  even across my chest  and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it's cut across the shoulders that don't allow for much movement. so  while beautiful and so incredibly soft  it has to go back.

This dress is very  very flattering which i was a little surprised about because i have a smaller chest! it is pretty long  coming to right around my knees and i love the buttons! i would say that the quality is not 100% there  it is very thin material but i am still very happy with it. i really wish they made this dress in other colors because i would buy them in a heartbeat! it is a perfect summer dress and i can't wait to wear it!!,1,Dresses

First of all  the photo online doesn't really do the colors of this skirt justice. it is a heathered knit  with colors of white  gold (deep yellow)  raspberry (or almost maroon)  and teal. i have never seen a color combo like this before  and its really fun. i am wearing it today with a burgundy color sweater  but i anticipate being able to match it for summer with any of those colors i just mentioned  or even navy or tan. the skirt has a lining in it  and the wide ribbed knit runs at varying an,1,Skirts

I ordered this in a size s  my usual size and it fits great. i love the color  style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of  ever so slightly  poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color  i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!,1,Dresses

Love this bra! i was looking for something feminine and sexy and this is perfect. it's exactly as pictured. i was worried the material would be too delicate and fragile  but it's really durable! my only issue is that it fits a tiny bit awkwardly because of the solid material on the side  but it doesn't actually look awkward  just feels a bit odd at first. i highly recommend it if you're looking for something sweet and sexy!,1,Intimates

Outstanding dress. looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come. i couldn't decide which color way i liked in this dress----the red/white or the green  so i purchased both. i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtime/summer dress. yes  the cut runs small but i don't think it is as small as some of the other reviews. i typically wear i size 6  and this one the 8 fit perfectly  so maybe one size up.,1,Dresses
So i really like this top. not my usual choice  but i'm trying to branch out. really like the top (i got the white one because they had it in my size). only thing is i could have sized down but arms/shoulders/bust are super tight so i went with the larger size. i got mine on sale and a button had already fallen off the back so forewarning that may be a problem in future....     but overall i really like this top.,1,Blouses
This top is beautiful. i would say the pink stands out more in the print in person than in the picture  and it's gorgeous. the adjustable strap is nice. there is just enough padding in this swimsuit to feel protected without being bulky or worrying about it moving around in the top. this is seriously my new favorite  could not recommend enough!    for reference  i am a 34a  and purchased a small.,1,Swim

This is different from any bra i've had before  in a good way. the lace over the front is really beautiful  and no annoying straps means it's comfortable! fit and support are both great. i didn't notice that it was silk when i ordered  so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant. i wasn't expecting an underwire  either  based on the s-m-l sizing  but it has one.,1,Intimates

Purchased this dress for a garden wedding and received so many compliments. the print is very lovely and the fit was true to size. i was mildly thrown off by the waffle texture of the material as it caused the dress to be a tad clingier than the picture led me to believe  but it was not a deal breaker. loved that it was lined and  though feeling substantial  was not heavy and thus comfortable in 90 degree weather. looking forward to wearing this again.,1,Dresses
This is such a pretty top. i do not feel it runs big  as another review mentioned. to fit the sleeves comfortably (i do not have large arms at all) i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model (a bit more of a tunic fit on me). it is really a pretty top either way  the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer. worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do.,1,Knits

Holy cow does this run small-like really small. i ordered the normal size i would wear and couldn't even get it passed my legs-until i supplied the most amount of effort i could (against my better judgment) and managed to get it on-but it was definitely too small. i would classify myself as petite and my normal size was way too short on my torso. it  of course  was a mistake to force it on because it was just as hard to get it off.  that said  i love the suit and am going to try in one and 2 siz,1,Swim
I just saw this vintage style blouse at my local store and tried it and think this blouse is amazingly beautiful! it's actually very well made and a tad heftier than i imagined from the picture. there's different strips of gorgeous lace all over including that amazing lace at the collar and bib  the arm holes are just perfect in my regular size small (34d-27-35) so it runs tts and i didn't find this overly blousy myself though that's just part of its charm. you'll need an undershirt or something,1,Blouses

I came across this in the store and immediately fell in love with it. the online photos just don't do it justice! i bought the white version because the little pops of red in the details and the dobby weave are so sweet and unique.     a size 0 fit perfectly. the fabric is a bit sheer  so be prepared to wear a cami underneath. very light  airy  and comfortable!,1,Blouses
A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully. this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull. mine fits perfectly. i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me. it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan. the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm. just adore it!,1,Blouses

This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through  but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile.,1,Knits

"I'm a little on the fence about this dress. it doesn't do much for my fairly straight/petite body type; i.e. it's not fitted at the waist which i think would help even though i don't have much of a waist to begin with. but the low v-neck is flattering and the flared skirt is too. it's just that it probably looks better on an hourglass shape... i was fine with the fabric type  i'd describe it as a mid-weight ribbed knit blend. i'd say it's true to size  i got my usual xspetite and i'm 34aa  26"" ",1,Dresses

Love the color  ordered the plum. it is very nice in person  not quite as burgundy  more purple-y... i don't typically go for the plain dresses  as i feel at the price  it should be a statement  but i don  't have a dress like this:    wearable as casual or dressed up  solid plain color  soft fabric  long sleeves  yet sexy enough without being too much  flirty (it is on the shorter side)    i decided to keep it as dolan makes a similar dress every year  and i pass every year... this is the year,1,Dresses

Beautiful color and flattering design! cons: tends to get wrinkled and you have to be careful about ironing. i ended up buying the shirt twice because i burned a hole in it while trying to use a poor quality hotel iron. i didn't even have a chance to wear it  but i loved the shirt so much that i bought it again since it was a good sale price.,1,Knits
I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small  but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine  yes  it is a little hard to zip up  but once on  it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling,1,Trend
I love this shirt! red + navy is one of my fave color combos  and the vintage feel is fantastic. the fabric is a little thicker and more sweater-like than i was expecting  but it's a good thing. the top isn't heavy  but the knit gives it more texture & interest. this is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy look...covered  but form-fitting and flattering.,1,Fine gauge

Someone else mentioned that this fit like a grandpa sweater and they were absolutely right. it's definitely loose fitting  but it's really cute and well made. i usually get a medium size in tops/sweaters but  after reading the other reviews  i ordered the small and i'm so glad i did - it's the perfect casual cardigan. i wish it came in more colors!,1,Knits
I saw this dress online this morning  went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it! i love this brand because the designs are modest  but feminine and practical. this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery. the fit is tts  and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug. the length is just above my knee at 5'3. i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest  and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies!,1,Dresses

I totally disagree with previous reviewer on sizing. i am usually a medium (sometimes small) in various retailer tops and i purchased this top in a small. i could barely get it over my head. i then ordered the medium and large. i tried the large on first and it fits perfectly.

The fabric on this top is just so soft. it's a thin cotton knit  and drapes beautifully.    the top runs tts  but.....it is tailored to the body. it's not loose and wide in the width. the length hits the top of the hips just as shown.    this works for casual or dress. for dress  i just put a fancy rhinestone pin over where the knot is. btw  i bought this in black  which is why adding the pin glams it up. although i bought it in black  it's not sheer so a cami isn't needed.,1,Knits

The delicate detail at the neckline on this sweater adds such a pretty yet subtle touch. i layer it with various camis for a different look each time. i ordered the dark yellow and it is a very unique and rich shade  and goes well with so other many colors. looks gorgeous with a mint or aqua cami for a peek a boo effect. classic yet unique! runs very true to size.,1,Fine gauge
After reading the other reviews  i felt compelled to write one for this top. it is not often that i get to shop at an retailer store  but a few weeks ago  i had the pleasure. i saw this top  and while it was not on sale  i had to have it. yes  it is sheer and so you do need a camisole under it. the gold and silver embroidery is gorgeous. to be honest  this is my favorite top in my closet right now. i can dress it up or make it more casual. and  now that it's on sale  don't hesitate in this purchas,1,Knits

While i have to agree with some other reviewers that this is not the most flattering coat (as a size 12/14 with hips  it does my hips no favors)  but the comfort and warmth make up for it. this coat is so soft  it's like wearing a puffy blanket. unlike typical puffer coats  it does not have any kind of vinyl feel to it- but nor does it have any wind or water resistance at all. with all that said  the comfort and cosy feel won me over. i've received several compliments as well  so maybe it's more,1,Outerwear

I absolutely adore peplum tops  although some of them are made for individuals with short torsos. this one is beautifully designed with a long torso and flowing wrists. there is a nice balance between the fitted torso and then the flowing peplum and sleeves. the best thing of all is the fabric  which is a stretchy mid-weight jacquard. it is easy to get on  with a zipper in the back. i am sure i will get a lot of use out of this as the weather turns cooler and i plan on pairing it with pencil ski,1,Knits
This was a nice surprise because it's a thick sweatshirt type of fabric. don't be deterred! it is nothing like a sweatshirt. it's comfy like a sweatshirt though. i'm 5 feet tall 120 pounds. i ordered my usual size petite small and it fit perfectly. what little height i have is in my torso. i didn't find that the top was short at all. it's without a doubt tts. order your usual size. if you have a tummy or bootie this top is the ticket! the description on the fabric details that the other reviews,1,Knits
I bought this in the dark gray and it's got a lot of blue undertones to it. it's beautiful and flattering in my regular size  not too fitted -- not as loose as on the model but still roomy enough. i'll take the advice of a previous reviewer and wash only the armpits when needed. this fabric is so delicate i'm afraid it will shrink if i ever submerge the whole thing in water. it's a gorgeous piece and i'm happy to have it for the remaining cool days of the season.,1,Fine gauge

I absolutely love this dress! the fit is great and the elastic waist helps to show off your shape. it's great for the warmer fall weather we have in the south  but i can put tights with it when it gets colder. the dress is thin  but not sheer so there's no need for a liner. i'm 5'8  weigh 144lbs and ordered this dress in a size 10. i think i might have been able to wear an 8  but the 10 fit so well that i kept it.,1,Dresses

I was lucky enough to get these on sale with an additional 40% off  making them a fabulous deal. they are nicely made  and the shade of blue is very pretty. my only complaint  and the reason i'm on the fence is that they are so big. i usually buy a 31 in the ag stevie jeans  occasionally a 32  so i figured i'd be safe sizing down to a 30. wrong. i could have gone to a 29  and possibly even a 28....they're that big! i do like them though  and may just try shrinking them in the dryer.,1,Jeans

I've only worn the sweater a handful of times  but i'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is. it's a bit on the baggier side  but that doesn't stop it from looking great. i've gotten complements on it every time i've worn it. i would highly recommend it to people who don't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles.,1,Sweaters
While overall it's a pretty top  there were a few surprises. the biggest one not listed is that the bottom has a thin elastic band! without it  the top would be wide  longer and flow. in the picture to get it to the length shown  the elastic is pulled up toward the waist. which could work for some  as you can adjust the length into a tucked in look. it could be cut off  and sewn  making a normal flowy top. i am a normal size 6 and the shoulders are off  and the sleeve length is long with elastic,1,Blouses

This is a cool relaxed style with the benefit of an open neckline to add a bit of femininity. i tried on the faded blue and striped colors in the store. the faded blue goes well with the style  but the stripe is cute too. the sleeves are quite long and too tight to roll up  so if you are petite like me you will definitely want to order the petite size- and probably even those you who are in between petites and regular sizes. the sleeves may also be too narrow for some people.,1,Knits

I saw this on a mannequin at the store and was instantly drawn in by all the beautiful blue lace and the overall design. however  when i tried it on  i personally found a few things that just didn't work for me:  ____________  pros:  - blue lace is lovely throughout  nicely done.  - there's a little snap closure at the front of the dress where the fabric overlaps at the bra cups. i can only assume it's to make it easier to get the dress on. it's a nice little detail  although not sure if really,1,Dresses

This shirt is awesome. i absolutely love the style of this shirt! it's super flowy  and is a really breathable fabric. i've been wearing this shirt a lot lately with printed pants. the only downside is the quality of material. it kind of feels like this shirt could have been made myself with a plain t shirt and some basic sewing skills. it also feels like it's going to start falling apart at the arm seams. nonetheless  i adore the shirt  and will be getting a lot of use out of it this season! no,1,Knits

The texture  mixed yarn  and beading make for a lovely variation on the fairisle. as other reviewers have said  the length is not as long as it appears in the picture. the color is a very dark navy  almost black. the neck opening is larger than a standard crew sweater but lays mostly flat. the overall look is boxy. i'm 5'7 and normally wear a medium in retailer sweaters. i changed to a large so it would be longer and have a roomy drapy feel.,1,Sweaters
I initially ordered the grey in a m per my usual sizing but on trying it on realized that the m was a bit frumpy and there was a lot of additional fabric at the back which tended to wrinkle very easily because it is cotton. i sized down to a s and was much happier with the fit and the overall look of the jacket. but i think this jacket may need some ironing once in a while. the grey color is a darker grey as per the product description and the pictures.,1,Jackets

I passed this over on first sight because it looked like it might be on the short side in length. after seeing a few other photos and reading the reviews  i opted to give it a go. the store did not have my usual xs or even a size small  so i tried on the medium. it was too wide as expected  but the shoulders are adjustable so i fiddled with it a bit and decided it was really cute. there were no more xs available to order so i asked if the store could order the small. it arrived and is absolutely,1,Fine gauge

Just picked this up at my retailer and i just love it. its totally different than your typical tee. the bottom is more of a blousy silk material and the top is a super soft knit. it lays really well and is long enough to wear with leggings! my favorite part is the t strap in the back. such a beautiful detail and so much fun. my only criticism with this top is where it hits on the bust. im a little more full figured  so the top looks better on me when the silk part isn't under my boobs. kinda have,1,Knits

I tried this top in both colors. for the black  the lining looks much more peach in person. the main issue though is the diagonal line that runs through the middle of the top. you can see it in the picture  but is much more pronounced in person. it appears to be where 2 pieces of lace are sewed together and it just looks sloppy.  the line is much less obvious in the navy  and looks much more seamless  perhaps because there is a transition between two colors of lace. the black lining is completel,1,Knits

Boy is this a winner. the fabric has quite a bit of stretch  so it is form fitting but with enough structure that it doesn't make you bulge out in weird places. i can wear it with a blazer as a (admittedly dressy) day-to-evening look  and i can tell i'm going to get a lot of mileage out of it for the season's holiday parties. i am bigger on bottom than on top  and sometimes that can end up with weird bagginess around the bust for me  but not with this dress. i'm tall #5'8) and so the length is g,1,Dresses

This dress is nicely made and hangs beautifully. i did find the shoulders a bit too wide even though i have pretty broad shoulders. then again  i'm also pretty tall and the length on this dress is really nice  so i'll take the slightly wide shoulders. the low back and gathered waist are very flattering. a perfect dress to wear in the summer!,1,Dresses
I loved the style when i saw it online and even more in person. the fabric is light but not too light. it has a nice drape i didn't expect. easy to wear and style. the draw string gives it a great shape but a belt is a great addition for more interest. the length is fantastic as well. wonderful midi length but with the side slits.,1,Dresses

This is such a unique piece and could be dressed up or down. i can see myself wearing this with skinny jeans and a tee and adding a statement necklace or wearing over a dress. i tend to get hot so i like how light weight this is even though it is lined. it is of excellent quality but may run slightly small (or at least smaller than other items i have purchased through retailer). the drape is extremely flattering and i think that would be true for every figure. my favorite feature is the oversized,1,Outerwear
This top is lovely! exquisite embroidery in a silvery-beige color compliments the deep plum. the fit is close to highlight your curves  while being just a touch comfy. very chic for a jazzed up outfit for a night out with jeans or black pants and your best booties. i wear a size 8 normally and the medium fits me perfectly. my body type is curvy and athletic.,1,Knits
I found this to fit tts. i sometimes wear petite  but found the petite sizing to be a little off. i have a pretty short torso  but found the petite to be too short. i opted for the regular sizing and got a 6; it fits great. this top is great for work (styled with a cardigan or blazer) or for play. i can see it dressing up or down very easily.,1,Blouses
Looks great with skinny jeans or even white pants. i have wider hips (usually an 8 or 10 on bottom) and narrower shoulders (small or medium on top). i bought the medium and probably should have sized down to the small as this was a little large on me but the top still looked good being oversized. i am a 34b and did not have any issues with button gap. my only negative is that the material wrinkles easily. the floral detail on both the pocket and the sleeves is a nice touch.,1,Blouses

This suit is better than i expected. i'm a large d cup and with this type of top style  i typically size up. i'm a 4 bottom but would normally would order a large top because this type of top runs small...not here. i ordered the large and  much to my suprise  it's too big. i'm sending back. i may order a small and medium just to be safe  but the cups are definitely not cut too small here. the bodice is very flattering with the black and white contrast. so pretty!,1,Swim
I love this sweater. i ordered the xs because i have very narrow hips and i didn't want it to be too baggy. it fits a little like a very short sweater dress on me. what i really love is that the arms are nice and long. one of my pet peeves is sweaters that are compromised in arm length.   i bought the pink and plan to get at least one other color too!,1,Sweaters

I love pilcro and this pair is another proof why i love it! i bought a pair in light red - the color is so pretty. the fit is perfect. i normally wear petites  but this time bought a regular length  and i love it. it is not too long  as the pants are cropped  and not too short as the petite cut might have been.  pilcro never disappoints me  as i have many different pairs and love each one of them. may go for another color in this same style. they are awesome!!,1,Jeans
This t- shirt is adorable. i saw this in the catalog and ordered it immediately- despite the $50 price tag. cute with jeans  khakis  shorts  under a denim jacket  the options are endless. print is very cute but the sizing and quality left something to be desired. the material is extremely thin- it will be a matter of time before holes develop... no matter how careful you are. i ordered a large to be roomy and it was way too big.,1,Knits

Knitted and knotted makes such gorgeous sweaters:  this is bathed in lovely  almost impresssionistic color  and the deep ruffle at the bottom is feminine and flattering.  i adored the way there's enough wrap-around to get cozy in it  as i wore it through my day.  i went with the green in a regular medium  which is my normal size:  size 8  34f.  the 27% mohair enhances the soft feeling and lush look.  as i wore this piece today  i felt that i was wearing something very special.,1,Sweaters

This henley has a lot of very nice details (lace  embroidery). the material is soft and a little bit sheer (more so in the lacey sections). it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking. the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltage..but there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration (you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only). this irks me a bit  because i would like to button the sh,1,Knits
This is such a lovely dress -- and it looks great on! like other customers  i like the petal hem and the top part  which is stretchy  is soft and not clingy.     i think the only drawback is that the color isn't as rich a green as it looks in the pic. i've attached a pic for comparison and contrast purposes.    i'll be wearing this way into the fall!,1,Dresses

I got this dress in the holly green and it's a lovely shade - perfect for fall and winter. this is why i gave it the high rating. however  be warned that the lining is very form fitting. i thought the dress had more of a fit and flare design to mask flaws like a belly and larger backside  but that's not the case. i had to return it  but for more slender-shaped ladies  the dress is likely a winner.,1,Dresses
"This dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. it has a forgiving a line shape to it for women like me who are pear shaped. the top of the dress is made of a heavy type of cotton material and the bottom tiers are made of a silky material that hangs beautifully! even the tie closure in the back of the dress adds a lovely touch to the dress. i would recommend wearing it with leggings ( as shown with the model) or black tights. the fit is true to size. i am 5'6"" and the length is a liittle low",1,Dresses
The print of this dress is what enticed me  and it did not disappoint. the fabric is a nice shade of medium grey with cream printing. however  the fabric is very thin. thankfully the top part is lined  but the bottom is not and it should be. this lightweight dress great for hot summer days  but for the price it really should be lined on the bottom as well.   the dress is more a-line than pictured  which i liked. the bust is fitted and there is elastic in back. the skirt is fairly loose and flare,1,Lounge

This tank is wonderful for those with full hips because it hangs just right to cover any flaws. the colors are bright and the material is soft. there is a band at the end that elevates the tank so you can wear it out if you would like. not too low in the front and overall the tank runs true to size. i suppose if you wanted a tighter fit you could size down 1 size  but i like the way it hangs in my regular size. i'm very busty and hippy and this top makes both look slim. highly recommend.,1,Knits

I love the color  the fabric and the style (especially in the model shots) but in reality  the cut is disproportionate. the hips and hip pockets flare out creating a saddlebag look. it is not smooth and fitted as shown on the model. overall you need to size down since i could pullover the dress without unzipping. i think the felted boiled wool is great quality but a tiny bit itchy. i still recommend the dress because i will be wearing it with a long sweater coat which will hide the weird hip act,1,Dresses

My husband saw this in the store while shopping with me and asked me to try it on. i don't normally go for patterns like this  but i thought it was cute and springy.    i tried on a large first  since i prefer to cover my belly and allow for my broad shoulders.

The skirt is lovely  has beautiful colors   and the touch of lace takes it to that ultra feminine level. it's a lot of skirt---yards of material and i like that it is fully lined  but this creates a problem  the source of the only negative thing i have to say about it. the only criticism i have is with the waistband---it's much too flimsy to stay up on the waist because of the weight of the skirt. i had my seamstress add a heavier weight elastic band inside the one it has or the skirt would star,1,Skirts

I ordered the navy/gray version in size xl. it fits me true to size  matching the online photos. the colors matched too. the fabric is so soft. it's warm while being lighter in weight. very comfortable. the collar wasn't bulky either. it's made to last. one of my retailer favorites.,1,Knits
This seems to be designed to fit a bit loose  but not in a bad way (for me). the floral pattern on the collar with the polka dots on the rest of the dress are very cute  and i think this can look good with or without a belt. light for summer but still covers a lot  which is nice for the office. the sleeves are a little short  but it doesn't look bad. glad i snatched it.,1,Dresses

This is a great tee.... i bought this in the green in a size m. i'm normally a small but because of the fitted look  i opted for the medium. i probably could have sized down to the small  but the medium is still fitted just not too tight  which is actually a nice look. the only thing i wish was different are the sleeves. the sleeves are just a little too puffy for me  but it's so cute that i'm keeping it.,1,Knits
This top is very cute. it looks good with leggings  boyfriend jeans  and flare jeans. be careful  it will shrink. i bought an xs because other reviews said it runs large. it fit great  but i accidentally put it in the dryer and it shrunk. the sleeves that were already were fitted and not loose like the picture shows  shrunk so that they are a little snug on my arms. thankfully  it's still wearable because i do love it and have gotten several compliments on it.,1,Knits

I have to agree with another poster who was dissapointed about the dress not being lined....i mean  any dress over $50 should at least be lined! but  overall this is an adorable dress  very flattering and so fun for summer! if it were lined i would have purchased  but that's all personal preference as i cannot stand having to wear a slip!,1,Dresses

Perfect little summer tunic that is very flattering. paired with a skirt  jeans or cropped black pants- this top is perfect! the cut in the front is not overly deep- so a cami is not necessary. i am usually a l or xl or 12 in retailer tops and i have a 10 in this top. so it is sized slightly larger than usual.,1,Blouses

This sweater was just what i was looking for.  it is so soft & comfortable.  the design is unique and delicate  yet doesn't shed or itch.  the decorations are not as pure white as pictured  there are several different tones of ivories & creams.  i ordered the xs  which is my typical size in retailer sweaters  as i find that most run very large and this is no exception.  it is oversize  but not bulky.  however  the decorations do add some volume  so maybe not for all body types.,1,Sweaters

I love this top! it's the perfect lightweight top for summer and the details are so feminine and pretty. the fit is extremely flattering. the arm holes are not too large (i.e. do not have to worry about exposing bra). i think you can dress it up with heels  wear it casually with shorts  & also pairs perfectly with kimonos. i'm 5'4  130 # and i took my usual retailer size in this  size small.,1,Knits

I wanted to love this top... it's gorgeous w/the beading and velvet. however  it really goes with nothing. i'm tall and slender... the top felt a bit cropped when i tried it on. very wide flare shape... but that wouldn't make me return it. what is making me send it back is the color. the grey is gorgeous  but the fabric is a buttery yellow color. i think i was picturing it more cream. i don't know what in the world you could wear this with... grey pants?! a grey pencil skirt?! it looks terrible,1,Blouses

This is great  lightweight top layer that's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down  or on a breezy day. it's sheer  so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model  which i like.,1,Layering

This top turned out to be better than expected! i'm a large girl and the length is enough to cover my hips and the shirt it not tight at all. the embroidery details are lovely too. i bought this for a trip to italy this summer because it is cotton and because i consider it to be a classic piece being that it is black and white. one nice feature is this top does not have to be worn off shoulder. it looks just great with the sleeves up.,1,Knits

I saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it. it is  as one of the reviewers said  like having two dresses in one. the bottom dress is a full dress  and the top lays over it  not quite skimming but not quite loose either. i love the dress as i am a pear shaped  size 14  and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely. this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries.,1,Dresses
The design is so cute (people in different yoga poses  small and subtle prints) and a must for a yogini. i love the colors  it's colorful but not too bright and it's beautiful against the white background. i ordered xs (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips) and it fit perfectly (it has a fitted look but not tight because it has some stretch from the soft cotton material). i like the fact that there's no stretchy spandex feel  just pure soft cotton feel. it's great for gals who are conscious about the arms,1,Knits

I think this is going to be a love or hate top. i love it. it is see through  requiring an under top. however  the fabric is extremely light weight and the style is floaty so a simple lightweight tank/cami will look pretty showing through in a number of colors. i bought the off-white. it is meant to be a full fit but i think going down one size will help especially since the photos don't show just how full the back really is. the fabric will probably snag easily. still i just really like the sty,1,Knits
I love this top  it gives a little bit of a sleeveless look yet is more flattering on the arms for those who don't normally wear sleeveless tops. i think it runs very large - i'm normally a size s/m and the extra small was right. it's loose around the waist yet has a feminine fit.the tiny balls around the neck  button at the back  flutter sleeves  and linen fabric are all cute details that make this top unique. i also like how the fluttering goes down the sides and not just around the sleeve.,1,Knits

I'm pretty flat-chested (34aa) so it's hard for me to say how the sizing runs on this top for others. to me  it's a slim fitting but not tight  true to size t-shirt. i tried the xs regular (dressing room photo) and the small petite (other photo) and i'd say the main fit difference was in the shoulders. the small petite fit me better in the shoulders (xs petite wasn't available). also the neckline of the small petite came up a little higher. the white is a slightly dingy off-white but i think the,1,Knits

This top is lovely; great colors for spring  light material  flow-y  and the cinching below the bust line creates a super flattering silhouette. i did have to size up to a 2 (i'm almost always a 0) to make some room for the girls (i'm a 32 c/d depending on the brand)  so larger chested women may want to size up  but it's well worth it,1,Blouses

I love the print and style of the skirt. it is very cute and feminine and can easily be worn into autumn. the downside is that the elastic waist is a little too loose and needs to be tighten. also  the is a lot of extra fabric in the skirt and makes it look so much larger than it is and it runs about 3 inches longer. for reference  i'm 5'5  34 24 35 and the xs is loose in the waist. still  i really love the skirt and plan on keeping it and having it altered.,1,Skirts
When i saw this i had to have it! i was pleasantly surprised that i was actually able to go down a size (normally a l for the bust) but was able to get into the medium with some room across the chest. it drapes nicely and the inner liner is not tight but flows along with the dress. so many compliments each time i wear it!,1,Dresses

I love this sweater. i bought it in black and love the way the back falls gently and flatters my figure. i'm curvy on bottom w/ a butt and tummy so i like to cover them but i don't want to look like i'm wearing a moo-moo. this top looks chic. it's the right shape to flow gently. it's just the right detail to be different in an understated way. i wear it w/ leggings and jeggings because it falls low enough to cover my butt. neckline is good-- i'm a 34b and it's flattering. not sure if it will fla,1,Fine gauge
The top looks exactly as pictured and i liked the fabric. the fit is classic and i will be able to wear this top many different ways. i was hoping that it was long sleeve but it is actually 3/4 sleeve.,1,Knits
This tee is super soft and thin. perfect for hot humid days. i went with the neutral version and it is adorable with chino shorts or jean shorts. i found it ran big.. i purchased in xs and still pretty baggy.,1,Knits
I loved this dress so much i got it in 2 colors. i had to send it back twice to get the size right. i ended up with a medium. the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival. it is dryclean only. overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute.,1,Dresses
This top runs a tad big. it's beautiful in person and sooooo soft. definitely an retailer staple top. material and cut is great,1,Blouses
Great top but it runs smaller than other tops in this brand. the chest and arm area is small. otherwise this top is great. just plan to size up one or two sizes. length was nice. hit right at the waist.,1,Blouses
"I have been looking at rompers for a while but being that i'm 40  a lot of stores seem to carry rompers that are super short. i think these are the perfect length for summer (and for me!). it's cute! i am 5'5"" and 110 pounds and i ordered the xs. i docked one start because the top part seems to have a bit of excess fabric. if i pull the waist up  the top 1/2 balloons out a little awkwardly. but if i pull the shorts down so that the drawstring is resting lower than my natural waist  it looks okay",1,Shorts
"This was a winner retailer!!!!! bought it with my birthday discount. a bit pricey  but when i wore it (over and over again) i can see why. the material is so soft  flows beautifully and is just the right length on me. i am petite (5'3"") slender at 115 and i wear it with wedge heels  just like the model. i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it again.    i have received many compliments on this dress. bought the washed denim look.    thank you!!!!",1,Dresses

I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant  cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store  but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets  you will love it.,1,Fine gauge
I found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top. the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty. the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress. it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater. i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it.,1,Blouses
I loved this dress and i am usually a 2 or 4 in dresses. this was cut too small on the bust. i'm a 32c and it pulled at the chest. i didn't re-order it because i felt it would look more like a house dress and be too baggy in the hips.,1,Dresses
The photos do not do this gorgeous dress justice. the iridescent material makes it perfect for a fancy date night and i received complements from complete strangers. would also be great as a wedding guest or bridesmaid dress!,1,Dresses
This is why i shop at retailer. i was in one of my local stores recently  mainly to check out the sale. my boyfriend was with me. we hadn't been in the store 5 minutes when we passed a table with piles of folded tees. this one caught my eye. the color  omg! and then flowers and butterflies! try it on  he said  as i held one up. no..... i shouldn't. we wandered around  checked out the sale and all the new. and i was back at that table looking at that tee. so  i took a small and an xs to the fitting,1,Knits

This is one of the most beautiful coat i've seen. could not wait to wear it. even found the perfect dress boots for it  but the first time i wore it all the buttons broke and fell off. the buttons have a thin plastic shank that you can break just by buttoning your coat. extremely poor quality. i had to have all the buttons remade. a coat this pretty and this expensive should at least have decent buttons. the inside of the coat is pink huge polka-dots- really cute. it also runs very small. i wear,1,Outerwear
Liked everything about this coat but the length! it is beautiful and good quality. first  ordered a medium because the fit seemed slight (i'm a 4-6)  returned it for a large. unfortunately  the large will also be returned -- the body length is very cropped  not at all as it appears in photo to meet the top of a waistband. i'll hope to find a similar coat with just a bit more length.,1,Outerwear
This top is even better than pictured. the colors are brighter  though still natural. this allows lots of possibilities with pairing bottoms to it. i ordered a large (my usual size) and would say it's pretty loose  but doesn't look ridiculous. it just hangs well and fits the way it should. the fabric is a little thin so you'll need a shade shirt or tank under it if you don't want your bra to show through.,1,Knits

I saw this online and immediately purchased the top in gray. it's so easy and casual but the shoulder detailing give it something different and unique for a regular gray shirt. the fit is loose and comfortable but not overly big  just right. i can't wait to pair it with my new white jeans for summer!,1,Knits

This top does look as pictured  the sleeves hit me the same and the size was true... i just didn't like it... it was shorter than i wanted in length and i just didn't feel like this top was worth the price so it's going back. i feel like i have had shirts with this texture and over time  they just didn't wear as well so i was afraid with 3 kids it wouldn't be a good idea. i paired it with a blazer and it looked great  but on it's on  i don't know  just not for me. for reference  i am 5'8'' 128lb,1,Blouses

The linen makes it a big wrinkly mess. i tried it on and just the act of trying it on  made it so wrinkly. i would have bought it in a second had it not been for that. love the mango color..i am in-between a 2-4 and went with the 2. i'm 5'3 and the length was a few inches above my knee...there is also a separate slip attached.  bummer.. maybe this won't bug some people but it would drive me mad. :-),1,Dresses

I bought this dress in black and i think it will be a great piece to transition with but definitely great during summer. doesn't come down too low on me which is sometimes an issue. the arm holes seem to be on the larger side. i'm 5'3 so it is not this short on me. i'm really happy with this purchase. plus it has pockets!,1,Dresses
This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost didn't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt  but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front  or leave it open. great looking  casual but stylish and neat. a good grey  and a good blue.,1,Jackets
This is a very cute  casual sweater. i originally ordered a size medium but i had to send it back because it was way too large all over. i recently received the size small and i'm going to keep it. it is still a roomy fit but the overall design of the sweater is a relaxed fit. the color combination and texture of this sweater is lovely.,1,Fine gauge
Ok  so by now  we know this is a cute top that is basically true to size but a little clingy. i prefer to wear it with a tank top or tee shirt underneath. it would also do well layered under something. for refernce  i am 5'7  about 120  and xs was the best fit.  but what i really wanted to mention is that i washed it in the machine on cold delicate and dried it on low  and it survived just fine!,1,Knits

This skirt is absolutely beautiful and is a gorgeous vintage red which is more pigmented than i'm used to in my closet  but that's not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. it runs a little large in the waist. also  the skirt comes up higher on the torso than pictured. mine comes up to slightly above my waistline and ends at about mid thigh. however  i love this skirt and its timeless design assures me it will stay in my wardrobe for years to come.,1,Skirts
Sporty  comfortable and good option to replace jeans  however material needs to be ironed. i bought these as a nice (dressier) alternative to jeans on my trip to europe but didn't end up wearing them b/c an iron wasn't readily available and the height of my ankle boots made the style look choppy. best to wear these with shoes that don't come above ankle.,1,Pants

I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down  but i bought it online  so i just decided to live with it. pretty top  though i do think it runs large.,1,Blouses

At 46 years old  i still like fun  hip  fashionable items  but i don't want to look like i raided my 21 year old daughter's closet. this jacket hits the mark perfectly. it looks great layered over a casual dress or with skinny jeans and a wedge. the embroidery and the back tie soften the masculine color and shape. i'll be wearing this often!,1,Jackets
No need to be on the fence about this top  it's lovely! what you see pictured here  is exactly what you get  even the color of the top is 100% accurate. for reference i'm usually an xl/16  apple shape  40 c bust  and this xl does not cling at all to me  so you may even be able to size down. the drape of the clipdot fabric is flattering  and thick enough not to need a cami. all of the fabrics used are nice and soft... and the details! it's going to be a beautiful spring!,1,Knits

I seriously love this top  and at the sale price it's a steal! i ordered the ivory color and it's just as beautiful in person as in the product photos. i thankfully read the reviews and knew that the sleeves would be slit. i think the slit sleeves add more interest to an otherwise basic blouse. it can be dressed up or down and is great for work (at least in my very casual office). the fit is perfect; i ordered my normal size medium and it's definitely true-to-size.,1,Knits

Beautiful  unique design. it's very flattering the way the fabric hangs.  i usually wear a 10  but because the lining is much smaller than the dress (which many linings are... it's a pet peeve of mine)  i sized up to a 12 and took in the shoulders a couple inches so the bodice area would sit correctly on my bust. otherwise in the 10 my stomach would feel squeezed even if it looked like it fit perfectly. that said  i'm very sensitive to that kind of thing.  other reviewers have noted that the emb,1,Dresses

This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed. these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy & fun. they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops. the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short (5'4) and the regular length fits me perfectly. this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me.,1,Jeans

Paige jeans are obviously known for their luxurious feel and amazing fit. these jeans are the best new addition to your collection. the perfect high rise and not as extreme flair  these might beat out your skinny jeans for your nights out. they do come extremely long  so they will most likely need to be hemmed. i get huge compliements when i wear them and told how they compliement my legs in the best way. if you're debating on whether to jump onto the flair trend  i'd go with these!,1,Jeans

This was really big on me. i am usually a 10 and even the 8 wouldn't stay up around the chest. i would need to have straps sewn on to make this work. on the plus side  the material is absolutely gorgeous. rich  saturated color. too bad about the fit. maybe really busty girls will have better luck  but this is going back. too expensive to justify keeping it if i need to spend money having it remade/tailored.,1,Dresses
